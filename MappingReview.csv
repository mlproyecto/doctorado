What Would the Matrix Do?: A Systematic Review of K-12 AI Learning Contexts and Learner-Interface Interactions;"Moore, Robert L.; Jiang, Shiyan; Abramowitz, Brian";2023;Journal of Research on Technology in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2022.2148785;Yes;;Yes;Yes;This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence's instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synThesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration.
ML4STEM Professional Development Program: Enriching K-12 STEM Teaching with Machine Learning;"Tang, Jingwan; Zhou, Xiaofei; Wan, Xiaoyu; Daley, Michael; Bai, Zhen";2023;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00292-4;Yes;;Yes;;The advances of machine learning (ML) in scientific discovery (SD) reveal exciting opportunities to utilize it as a cross-cutting tool for inquiry-based learning in K-12 STEM classrooms. There are, however, limited efforts on providing teachers with sufficient knowledge and skills to integrate ML into teaching. Our study addresses this gap by proposing a professional development (PD) program named ML4STEM. Based on existing research on supporting teacher learning in innovative technology integration, ML4STEM is composed of Teachers-as-Learners and Teachers-as-Designers sessions. It integrates an accessible ML learning platform designed for students with limited math and computing skills. We implemented this PD program and evaluated its effectiveness with 18 K-12 STEM teachers. Findings confirm that ML4STEM successfully develops teachers' understanding of teaching STEM with ML as well as fosters positive attitudes toward applying the ML as an in-class teaching technology. Discussions on the implications of our findings from ML4STEM are provided for future PD researchers and designers.
Using Fair AI to Predict Students' Math Learning Outcomes in an Online Platform;"Li, Chenglu; Xing, Wanli; Leite, Walter";2024;Interactive Learning Environments;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.
Enhancing Computational Thinking Skills through Artificial Intelligence Education at a STEAM High School;"Huang, Xiaodong; Qiao, Chengche";2024;Science & Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.
Integrating Machine Learning in Secondary Geometry;Jones, Joshua;2021;Mathematics Teacher: Learning and Teaching PK-12;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Despite the importance of artificial intelligence in our daily lives, it has yet to be integrated into K-12 classrooms in a meaningful way. This article explores a lesson in which geometry students use Euclidean distance to implement a functional machine learning algorithm in Google Sheets™. The assignment requires students to apply the distance formula to a machine learning context, break a data set into parts to establish relationships among its components, synthesize the analysis to implement an algorithm in Google Sheets, and use test data to evaluate the systems' accuracy.

Introducing Reinforcement Learning to High School Students through the Integration of Physical Robots and Virtual Interfaces;Zhang, Ziyi;2023;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;As artificial intelligence (AI) plays a more prominent role in our everyday lives, it becomes increasingly important to introduce basic AI concepts to K-12 students. Currently, most K-12 AI research focuses on introducing fundamental AI concepts using pure virtual platforms like webpages or software. However, robots, as helpful and popular tools in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) education, are infrequently used in K-12 AI education, and their role is not sufficiently explored. In this Thesis, I introduced educational robots and integrated them with an online platform and an augmented reality interface to help students learn key concepts in reinforcement learning (RL). I chose RL because it is conceptually easy to understand but has received the least attention in previous research on teaching AI to K-12 students. We designed a series of activities in which students can design their own robots and train them with RL to finish a variety of tasks. The activities and platforms were tested with two groups of high school students. Twenty students' engagement and learning results were assessed through qualitative analyses of their behavior and discussions by me and the class instructors. The role of robots and virtual platforms in motivating students and facilitating their learning was also discussed. The result showed that students were able to understand both high-level AI concepts and specific RL terms through our activities. Many students can even construct a deeper understanding of some of the RL concepts than we expected. Also, our approach of combining virtual platforms and physical robots provided students with an interactive and engaging learning experience. The implementation of robots inspired students' curiosity and solution diversity in resolving RL problems, while the integration of virtual platforms helped demystify key concepts of RL and enabled students to construct a deeper understanding of RL by providing them with an intuitive way to collaborate with their robots.

Integrating Machine Learning in Mathematics Classrooms;Jones, Joshua;2021;Mathematics Teacher: Learning and Teaching PK-12;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.5951/MTLT.2021.0001;Yes;;;;"Aside from being culturally relevant, artificial intelligence is also supporting companies in making business decisions. Consequently, ""workforce needs have shifted rapidly,"" resulting in a demand for applicants who are skilled in ""data, analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence"" (Miller and Hughes 2017). This article contributes to filling that need by exploring a lesson in which students learned how conditional probability is the crux of many machine learning algorithms, including predictive text applications. Prior to this lesson, students learned how to calculate conditional probability. Most students had also demonstrated that they were able to calculate experimental probabilities on the basis of a Venn diagram, on a word problem, and on a two-way table. The activity described in this article satisfies Common Core State Standard CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSS. CP.A.5."
Automating Feedback to Improve Teachers' Effective Use of Instructional Discourse in K-12 Mathematics Classrooms;Suresh, Abhijit;2022;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Over the past decade, robust literature focused on teacher ""talk moves"" that promote student argumentation has emerged, especially in mathematics education. Teachers and students can use talk moves to construct conversations in which students share their thinking, actively consider the ideas of others, and engage in sustained reasoning. Providing teachers with detailed feedback about the talk moves utilized in their lessons requires considerable human expertise. These highly trained observers must hand-code transcripts of classroom recordings, analyze talk moves and provide one-on-one expert coaching, a time-consuming and expensive process. Our research team developed Talkback - an innovative application to address a significant challenge in education: providing teachers with immediate and actionable feedback on their use of effective classroom discourse strategies. My work is situated in the research and development of a cyberinfrastructure for TalkBack, including deep learning models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) for automated feedback. Starting with a bidirectional long short-term memory (bi-LSTM) network, I explore different state-of-the-art deep learning models, including transformers, to automatically analyze classroom recordings and generate information about classroom discourse strategies with F1 measures up to 78.92%. The TalkMoves dataset used for training and evaluating these models was curated by an interdisciplinary research team and comprised 500+ human-annotated classroom transcripts. The strong performance of both the student and the teacher talk moves models illustrates the reliability and robustness of artificial intelligence algorithms applied to noisy real-world classroom data. TalkBack application serves as an example to support a well-specified theory of learning (accountable talk), addresses a recognized challenge in education (teacher feedback), and has the potential to scale to large classrooms and teachers. The ability to better understand teachers' perceptions and use of the TalkBack application can provide structured professional learning opportunities that promote discourse-rich pedagogy. Results from a mixed-methods study with teachers highlight several emergent themes relating to the perceived utility of TalkBack as an AI-based tool and serving as a platform for research and innovations in NLP and education.

Personalized Online Learning, Test Fairness, and Educational Measurement: Considering Differential Content Exposure Prior to a High Stakes End of Course Exam;"Katz, Daniel; Huggins-Manley, Anne Corinne; Leite, Walter";2022;Applied Measurement in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1080/08957347.2022.2034824;Yes;;;;"According to the ""Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing"" (2014), one aspect of test fairness concerns examinees having comparable opportunities to learn prior to taking tests. Meanwhile, many researchers are developing platforms enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI) that can personalize curriculum to individual student needs. This leads to a larger overarching question: When personalized learning leads to students having differential exposure to curriculum throughout the K-12 school year, how might this affect test fairness with respect to summative, end-of-year high-stakes tests? As a first step, we traced the differences in content exposure associated with personalized learning and more traditional learning paths. To better understand the implications of differences in content coverage, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate the degree to which curriculum exposure varied across students in a particular AI-enhanced learning platform for Algebra instruction with high-school students. Results indicate that AI-enhanced personalized learning may pose threats to test fairness as opportunity-to-learn on K-12 summative high-stakes tests. We discuss the implications given different perspectives of the role of testing in education"
DrawEduMath: Evaluating Vision Language Models with Expert-Annotated Students' Hand-Drawn Math Images;"Baral, Sami; Lucy, Li; Knight, Ryan; Ng, Alice; Soldaini, Luca; Heffernan, Neil T.; Lo, Kyle";2024;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;In real-world settings, vision language models (VLMs) should robustly handle naturalistic, noisy visual content as well as domain-specific language and concepts. For example, K-12 educators using digital learning platforms may need to examine and provide feedback across many images of students' math work. To assess the potential of VLMs to support educators in settings like this one, we introduce DrawEduMath, an English-language dataset of 2,030 images of students' hand-written responses to K-12 math problems. Teachers provided detailed annotations, including free-form descriptions of each image and 11,661 question-answer (QA) pairs. These annotations capture a wealth of pedagogical insights, ranging from students' problem-solving strategies to the composition of their drawings, diagrams, and writing. We evaluate VLMs on teachers' QA pairs, as well as 44,362 synthetic QA pairs derived from teachers' descriptions using language models (LMs). We show that even state-of-the-art VLMs leave much room for improvement on DrawEduMath questions. We also find that synthetic QAs, though imperfect, can yield similar model rankings as teacher-written QAs. We release DrawEduMath to support the evaluation of VLMs' abilities to reason mathematically over images gathered with educational contexts in mind.

Enhancing K-12 Students' STEM Learning through the Integration of the Metaverse into Online and Blended Environments: A Meta-Analysis;"Geng, Xingyu; Su, Yu-Sheng";2024;International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The metaverse offers unique opportunities for K-12 students to learn STEM subjects in online and blended settings, providing interactive and authentic experiences. Although previous studies have produced mixed findings on the influence of the metaverse on perceptions and academic achievement of online and blended STEM learning, it is necessary to study the overall impact of the metaverse on K-12 students' STEM learning and how the related factors, such as technologies used, pedagogical approaches, learners' education levels, and domains of learning, modulate STEM learning outcomes. Therefore, the study applied a meta-analysis method to assess the influence of the metaverse on K-12 students' academic achievement and perceptions of STEM in online and blended learning settings, while also examining the moderating effects in 49 studies. The effect sizes for academic achievement and perceptions were estimated to be 0.821 (indicating a great impact) and 0.575 (indicating a moderate impact), respectively. The moderation analysis showed that the learning domains and learners' education level were significant moderators of the influence of the metaverse on their academic achievement, with elementary students showing greater improvement in science subjects. Moreover, the technologies used and pedagogical approaches played a pivotal role as moderators in shaping students' perceptions of the impact of the metaverse, with VR and AR technologies and inquiry-based learning being particularly effective in terms of enhancing learner perceptions. Thus, it is recommended for teachers to actively utilize the metaverse for STEM teaching, while considering their students' educational level, learning domain, appropriate technology use, and pedagogical approaches.
Artificial Intelligence in Mathematics Education: A Systematic Literature Review;"Mohamed, Mohamed Zulhilmi bin; Hidayat, Riyan; Suhaizi, Nurain Nabilah binti; Sabri, Norhafiza binti Mat; Mahmud, Muhamad Khairul Hakim bin; Baharuddin, Siti Nurshafikah binti";2022;International Electronic Journal of Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.29333/iejme/12132;Yes;;;;The advancement of technology like artificial intelligence (AI) provides a chance to help teachers and students solve and improve teaching and learning performances. The goal of this review is to add to the conversation by offering a complete overview of AI in mathematics teaching and learning for students at all levels of education. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using established and robust guidelines. We follow the preferred Reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). We searched ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer Link, ProQuest, and EBSCO Host for 20 AI studies published between 2017 and 2021. The findings of the SLR indicate that AI approach used in mathematics education forthe samples studied were through robotics, systems, tools, teachable agent, autonomous agent, and a comprehensive approach. Then, it can be shown that the majority of the collected studies were carried out in the USA and Mexico. The analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies used quantitative research methods. The types of themes for AI in mathematics education were categorized into advantages and disadvantages, conceptual understanding, factors, role, idea suggestion, strategies and effectiveness.
;"Singh, Ajay; Yeh, Chia Jung; Blanchard, Sheresa; Anunciação, Luis";2021;;Book;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Rehabilitation professionals working with students with disabilities and the families of those students face unique challenges in providing inclusive services to special education student populations.

Toward Ethical and Just AI in Education Research;"Barnes, Tiffany; Burriss, Sarah; Danish, Joshua; Finkelstein, Samantha; Humburg, Megan; Limke, Ally; Molvig, Ole; Reichert, Heidi";2024;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Research and development work in artificial intelligence in education (AIED) is wide ranging and rapidly growing to support all areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning. At the risk of hyperbole, this is potentially the most fundamentally game-changing technology for education to emerge since the internet. Building from decades of work on AI and AI-based learning and teaching technologies, the recent advances in AIED are pushing us to reimagine what is possible for STEM teaching and learning. AIED research initiatives are being speedily funded, and AIED advances are quickly becoming integrated into STEM education. It is transforming how teachers teach and how students learn. It is also transforming how education developers and researchers conduct their expansive work. There is excitement about the promise of AIED as well as growing concern that the breakthroughs in AIED are impacting everyday education practice in ways that may perpetuate long-standing biases and diminish the potential for positive outcomes. This brief is the first in a three-part series on AIED related to STEM research, teaching, and learning. The topics address ethical approaches to AI in STEM education research, AI for STEM teaching, and AI for STEM learning. This series is sponsored by the Community for Advancing Discovery Research in Education (CADRE), a National Science Foundation-funded network for STEM education researchers endeavoring to improve STEM teaching and learning through research, development, and various information-sharing and community-building mechanisms. Researchers in the CADRE network are part of a portfolio of projects funded through NSF's Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program. The DRK-12 portfolio is wide-ranging, with a multitude of projects that focus on applied research and development to generate innovative research-informed and field-tested tools, products, and approaches that are intended to enhance STEM teaching and learning. Over the past several years, the portfolio has grown to include an increasing number of projects that leverage AIED to achieve their goals related to teaching or learning. It is expected to continue to grow. This series has been inspired by the question, ""What are the essential considerations for researchers and developers who are designing, studying, and using AI in K-12 STEM?"" Our hope is that the opportunities and challenges discussed in this series will generate reflection and rich discussion for the better and support the transformative use of AI to achieve positive and wide-reaching impact for all learners. In this first brief, ""Toward Ethical and Just AI in Education Research,"" the authors are concerned with the ethical reasoning and decisions made in the development, study, and use of AIED technologies. Recognizing that AIED technologies reflect both the intended and unintended biases of the designers and the wider society, they advocate for the adoption of policies and practices that prioritize ethics, equity, and justice in research and development initiatives using AIED technologies in K-12 education. In an effort to provide guidance to researchers and developers, they lay the groundwork for responsible AI research and its implementation in educational settings. This foundation draws in part from the ethics rules for research with human subjects that have guided researchers for decades, but goes beyond this to frame a more all-encompassing stance rooted in justice and equity. The authors illustrate how ethical AI research can be strengthened by building from well-established ethical principles used in research and society at large. Taking into account these principles, they propose an ethical AIED framework and a set of tools that they have found to be supportive of continuous reflection, communication, and improvement toward inclusive and equitable AIED research and development. Their guidance is in the service of ensuring that the good intentions of researchers and developers will lead to positive design decisions and actions that create inclusive AIED technology products and systems. This is a valuable contribution that encourages a shift in focus to bring ethics, justice, and the values of communities of teachers, students, and families to the forefront of research and development practice."
The Effect of AI-Based Systems on Mathematics Achievement in Rural Context: A Quantitative Study;"Khazanchi, Rashmi; Mitri, Daniele Di; Drachsler, Hendrik";2025;Journal of Computer Assisted Learning;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/jcal.13098;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Background: Despite educational advances, poor mathematics achievement persists among K-12 students, particularly in rural areas with limited resources and skilled teachers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States. Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups. Implications: The findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings.
A Machine Learning Approximation of the 2015 Portuguese High School Student Grades: A Hybrid Approach;"Costa-Mendes, Ricardo; Oliveira, Tiago; Castelli, Mauro; Cruz-Jesus, Frederico";2021;Education and Information Technologies;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This article uses an anonymous 2014-15 school year dataset from the Directorate-General for Statistics of Education and Science (DGEEC) of the Portuguese Ministry of Education as a means to carry out a predictive power comparison between the classic multilinear regression model and a chosen set of machine learning algorithms. A multilinear regression model is used in parallel with random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting machine stacking ensemble implementations. Designing a hybrid analysis is intended where classical statistical analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms are blended to augment the ability to retain valuable conclusions and well-supported results. The machine learning algorithms attain a higher level of predictive ability. In addition, the stacking appropriateness increases as the base learner output correlation matrix determinant increases and the random forest feature importance empirical distributions are correlated with the structure of p-values and the statistical significance test ascertains of the multiple linear model. An information system that supports the nationwide education system should be designed and further structured to collect meaningful and precise data about the full range of academic achievement antecedents. The article concludes that no evidence is found in favour of smaller classes.
Didactic Activities on Artificial Intelligence: The Perspective of STEM Teachers;"Fissore, Cecilia; Floris, Francesco; Marchisio, Marina; Sacchet, Matteo";2022;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) might seem something very distant from the world of schools: a theme that is far from today's reality, especially when the education and training system is committed to tackling the problems associated with the pandemic situation. However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme ""Mathematics and AI"" which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI."
The Mathematics of Facial Recognition: Statistics Teachers' Adaptations to a Machine Learning Curriculum;Delaney, Victoria Leah;2024;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Today's students are surrounded by machine learning (ML)-powered tools. Yet, few understand how they work. While there are numerous opportunities for students to learn about ML in informal settings (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2022; Druga et al., 2022) and online (e.g., code.org, Scratch), there are far fewer opportunities in the United States for students to learn about how ML works while they are in school. Although curriculum and standards frameworks have been developed to help educators navigate machine learning education, it is not yet known if teachers can or want to enact ML curriculum in their practice. As a former classroom teacher and ML graduate student, I saw interdisciplinary commonalities between machine learning and statistics, the subject I used to teach. In response, I co-designed a one-unit curriculum, ""The Math of Facial Recognition"" (""FaceID""), with a practicing high school teacher. We built the curriculum with three goals: (1) that it would aim to help teachers and students build high-level intuitions about ML, (2) that it would draw from teachers' and students' prior statistics knowledge, and (3) that it would bridge statistics and ML concepts by exploring facial recognition in smartphones, a ML application that students likely use everyday. We built custom web applications, termed ""widgets,"" with the purpose of enabling students to explore and test hypotheses about facial recognition using images of themselves. Finally, we designed the curriculum with features that intentionally encouraged statistics teachers to adapt segments and activities of lessons for their students. That teachers would adapt a curriculum for instruction is not surprising; in fact, it is an expected component of good teaching. Drawing from studies in curriculum theory, I argue that teachers' adaptations of curriculum - from written documents, to teacher-intended curricula, to jointly-enacted curricula between teachers and students - are supported by their pedagogical design capacity (PDC) (Brown, 2009). In the context of my study, PDC refers to statistics teachers' diverse resources as designers of instruction: their statistics pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), subject-matter knowledge of statistics, students PCK, general knowledge of pedagogy, and their goals. Teachers' goals may or may not align with goals stated in the written curriculum, which can influence their adaptations. Two key goals of this work are to investigate how teachers' PDC supported their ability to adapt ""FaceID,"" and to identify their rationales for making adaptations. To implement my study, I partnered with three experienced high school statistics teachers who agreed to enact ""FaceID"" in their classrooms. I observed each teacher's enactment, noting where and how teachers made adaptations. I interviewed each teacher before and after they taught the curriculum to learn about their prior knowledge, experiences, goals, and post-implementation, the nature of their adaptations. I also asked each teacher to identify their adaptations separately in a reflection document, because I was curious to understand how teachers defined an ""adaptation"" in their own practice. After concluding my field work, I analyzed the data to determine what adaptations teachers made to ""FaceID"" and their rationales for adapting segments and activities, taking note of instances where teachers interpreted their adaptations differently than the researchers.

Rewriting Math Word Problems to Improve Learning Outcomes for Emerging Readers: A Randomized Field Trial in Carnegie Learning's MATHia;"Almoubayyed, Husni; Bastoni, Rae; Berman, Susan R.; Galasso, Sarah; Jensen, Megan; Lester, Leila; Murphy, April; Swartz, Mark; Weldon, Kyle; Fancsali, Stephen E.; Gropen, Jess; Ritter, Steve";2023;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"We present a recent randomized field trial delivered in Carnegie Learning's MATHia's intelligent tutoring system to a sample of 12,374 learners intended to test whether rewriting content in a selection of so-called ""word problems"" improves student mathematics performance within this content, especially among students who are emerging as English language readers. In addition to describing facets of word problems targeted for rewriting and the design of the experiment, we present an artificial intelligence-driven approach to evaluating the effectiveness of the rewrite intervention for a sub-population of learners of interest. We hypothesize that the intervention may be especially effective to emerging readers using MATHia. Data about students' reading ability is generally neither collected nor available to MATHia's developers. Instead, we rely on a recently developed neural network predictive model that infers whether a student is an emerging reader. We present the results of the intervention on a variety of performance metrics in MATHia and compare performance of the intervention group to the entire user base of MATHia, as well as by comparing likely emerging readers to those who are not inferred to be emerging readers. We conclude with areas for future work using these kinds of more comprehensive models of learners.

Cultural Integration in AI-Enhanced Mathematics Education: Insights from Southeast Asian Educators;"Payadnya, I. Putu Ade Andre; Putri, Gusti Ayu Made Arna; Suwija, I. Ketut; Saelee, Sompob; Jayantika, I. Gusti Agung Ngurah Trisna";2025;Journal for Multicultural Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1108/JME-09-2024-0119;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in education, yet its cultural impact, especially in Southeast Asian mathematics education, remains underexplored. This gap is significant because understanding cultural adaptation is essential for AI tools to effectively enhance learning in diverse classrooms. This study examines how AI can be integrated into mathematics education across Southeast Asia, focusing on specific cultural practices such as communal learning styles, respect for hierarchical structures and the role of local languages, as well as educators' perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative data from questionnaires with qualitative insights from interviews with educators across ten Southeast Asian countries. The study included 543 respondents in total with the numbers is varying in each country, targeting high school teachers experienced in using AI in teaching. Findings: The findings revealed that educators in Singapore are most confident in AI's adaptability to cultural contexts, whereas those in Myanmar and Laos face challenges due to infrastructure limitations. Interviews highlighted the need to customize AI tools to align with students' cultural backgrounds, including language preferences and traditional learning practices, for effective implementation. Teacher training and access to technology, especially in rural areas, were also identified as critical factors. Originality/value: This study addresses a critical gap in understanding AI's cultural implications in Southeast Asia, providing insights into how cultural values, language and educational practices influence the integration of AI in mathematics education. The findings highlight the need for culturally responsive AI tools and targeted improvements in infrastructure and teacher training for successful implementation.
Fostering Problem Solving and Critical Thinking in Mathematics through Generative Artificial Intelligence;"Barana, Alice; Marchisio, Marina; Roman, Fabio";2023;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;The spread of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been recently generating worries among teachers and educators about the validity of assessment when students make use of AI tools to solve tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose mathematical problem solving activities to be carried out with the aid of ChatGPT, showing how problem solving and critical thinking continue to be pivotal in solving mathematical problems, even if this is performed with the aid of AI. After discussing theoretical frameworks on strategies of problem solving and phases of the critical thinking process, we present six problems of combinatorics that we submitted to ChatGPT. We also asked 40 university students to solve the six problems in group with the aid of ChatGPT during an international module on Problem Solving and Critical Thinking and collected the tutors' observations about the activities. Analyzing ChatGPT solutions and tutors' reflections, we show that the proposed activity requires problem solving and critical thinking to be accomplished. The results corroborate the idea that, instead of limiting the use of AI in education, it is possible to integrate it within learning and assessment to achieve the learning goals.

Educating Software and AI Stakeholders about Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics;"Bogina, Veronika; Hartman, Alan; Kuflik, Tsvi; Shulner-Tal, Avital";2022;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This paper discusses educating stakeholders of algorithmic systems (systems that apply Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning algorithms) in the areas of algorithmic fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics (FATE). We begin by establishing the need for such education and identifying the intended consumers of educational materials on the topic. We discuss the topics of greatest concern and in need of educational resources; we also survey the existing materials and past experiences in such education, noting the scarcity of suitable material on aspects of fairness in particular. We use an example of a college admission platform to illustrate our ideas. We conclude with recommendations for further work in the area and Report on the first steps taken towards achieving this goal in the framework of an academic graduate seminar course, a graduate summer school, an embedded lecture in a software engineering course, and a workshop for high school teachers."
Combining Statistical and Machine Learning Methods to Identify Predictors of Brazilian Students' Proficiency in PISA 2018;Soares, Pedro San Martin;2024;Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Brazil's education system lags behind international standards, with two-fifths of students scoring below the minimum level of proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. Thus, this study combined machine learning with traditional statistics to identify the most important predictors and to interpret their effects on proficiency in the PISA 2018 mathematics, science, and reading tests. Predictors encompassed a wide range of variables, sociodemographic characteristics, teaching and learning processes, and non-cognitive skills. The outcome of the present study was proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. PISA proficiency levels were grouped into ""low proficiency"" and ""proficient"" categories, using a classification system commonly employed in PISA Reports. Using random forest analysis, a machine learning method, I compared the importance of predictors for proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. I then adjusted multilevel logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the top predictors and the outcomes. Among the top predictors for the three outcomes identified, annual household income, parents' highest occupational status, and early childhood education and care were positively associated with proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading, while grade repetition and additional instruction were negatively associated with these outcomes. These findings urge Brazilian policymakers and educators to prioritize initiatives that strengthen early childhood programs, minimize grade repetition, and promote effective learning strategies."
Technology and Math Instruction: 10 Charts;"Kurtz, Holly; Lloyd, Sterling; Harwin, Alex; Daniels, Ashlee; Cheseldine, Sarah";2023;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;In a trend buoyed by new technology purchased to accommodate the remote learning necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic, educators are increasingly using devices and apps to teach core subjects, including math. This Report examines perceptions and experiences of teachers, principals, and district leaders around the use of such tools for math instruction. The results are based on an online survey administered by the nonprofit, nonpartisan EdWeek Research Center during the spring of 2023. Charts are used to tell the story of math technology use. The Report begins with a series of charts based on survey questions that asked math instructors (including those who taught math either full or part-time during the 2022-23 school year) about the quantity and quality of their math technology. It ends with several charts detailing teacher and administrator perceptions of incorporating Artificial Intelligence into math. [This Report was sponsored by SMART by Teq.]
Enhancing High-School Dropout Identification: A Collaborative Approach Integrating Human and Machine Insights;"Bulut, Okan; Wongvorachan, Tarid; He, Surina; Lee, Soo";109;Discover Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Despite its proven success in various fields such as engineering, business, and healthcare, human-machine collaboration in education remains relatively unexplored. This study aims to highlight the advantages of human-machine collaboration for improving the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making processes in educational settings. High school dropout prediction serves as a case study for examining human-machine collaboration's efficacy. Unlike previous research prioritizing high accuracy with immutable predictors, this study seeks to bridge gaps by identifying actionable factors for dropout prediction through a framework of human--machine collaboration. Utilizing a large dataset from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), two machine learning models were developed to predict 9th-grade students' high school dropout history. Results indicated that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the deep learning algorithm. Model explainability revealed the significance of actionable variables such as students' GPA in the 9th grade, sense of school belonging, self-efficacy in mathematics and science, and immutable variables like socioeconomic status in predicting high school dropout history. The study concludes with discussions on the practical implications of human-machine partnerships for enhancing student success.
The Way Forward for State Standardized Tests. Future of Testing in Education;"Jimenez, Laura; Boser, Ulrich";2021;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Federal law requires all public school students in grades three to eight to take an annual assessment in reading and math at the end of the year and requires students to take an assessment once during high school. The goal of this assessment is to measure the extent to which all students are meeting the state's academic standards. These standards must align with the knowledge and skills in reading and math that students need to succeed in first-year college reading and math courses. Ensuring all students are held to rigorous standards is a key goal of equity in education. Yet many question the value of yearly standardized testing in schools since the opportunity to receive a high-quality education and graduate high school adequately prepared for college-level academics is still wholly inequitable. Students who are Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic graduate high school at lower rates than their white peers, and they require catch-up coursework in college more often. What is more, the costs and time associated with assessments, delayed results, and failure of tests alone to improve students' academic results leave many to wonder if they are worth the effort at best, and at worst, if they harm students and punish teachers and schools. Still, there are ways to design an assessment to reduce the amount of time it takes to administer, ensure that it collects information about students throughout the year, or base the test on performing tasks. This Report describes the advancements in testing technology that make such assessments possible, and it concludes with recommended changes in federal testing policy to make the use of these designs effective. This Report is part three in a series about the future of testing in America's schools. Part one of the series ""Effective and Equitable Assessment Systems. Future of Testing in Education"" (ED617053) presents a theory of action that assessments should play in schools. Part two ""Artificial Intelligence. Future of Testing in Education"" (ED617052) reviews advancements in technology, with a focus on artificial intelligence that can powerfully drive learning in real time."
Teacher Perceptions of Training and Pedagogical Value of Cross-Reality and Sensor Data from Smart Buildings;"Rowe, Shawn; Riggio, Mariapaola; De Amicis, Raffaele; Rowe, Susan R.";234;Education Sciences;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This paper discusses elementary, and secondary (K-12) teachers' perceptions of cross-reality (XR) tools for data visualization and use of sensor data from the built environment in classroom curricula. Our objective was to explore the use of sensor-informed XR in the built environment and civil engineering (BECE) field to support K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) experiential learning and foster BECE-related career awareness. We conducted surveys and informal questionnaires with 33 primary and secondary teachers attending an annual two-day university-based teacher professional development workshop as part of a statewide STEM afterschool program serving students in rural communities. We assessed teachers' familiarity with, knowledge about, and appraisal of using cross-reality platforms and sensor data in classrooms and after school curricula. Findings show that, while all teachers Reported relatively high interest in learning about sensor applications and innovative interactive techniques, middle school teachers in particular were most likely to see value in using these applications for teaching and learning. Implications for teacher professional development are discussed.

Confounded or Controlled? A Systematic Review of Media Comparison Studies Involving Immersive Virtual Reality for STEM Education;"Lawson, Alyssa P.; Martella, Amedee Marchand; LaBonte, Kristen; Delgado, Cynthia Y.; Zhao, Fangzheng; Gluck, Justin A.; Munns, Mitchell E.; LeRoy, Ashleigh Wells; Mayer, Richard E.";2024;Educational Psychology Review;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;A substantial amount of media comparison research has been conducted in the last decade to investigate whether students learn Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) content better in immersive virtual reality (IVR) or more traditional learning environments. However, a thorough review of the design and implementation of conventional and IVR conditions in media comparison studies has not been conducted to examine the extent to which specific affordances of IVR can be pinpointed as the causal factor in enhancing learning. The present review filled this gap in the literature by examining the degree to which conventional and IVR conditions have been controlled on instructional methods and content within the K-12 and higher education STEM literature base. Thirty-eight published journal articles, conference proceedings, and dissertations related to IVR comparison studies in STEM education between the years 2013 and 2022 were coded according to 15 categories. These categories allowed for the extraction of information on the instructional methods and content characteristics of the conventional and IVR conditions to determine the degree of control within each experimental comparison. Results indicated only 26% of all comparisons examined between an IVR and conventional condition were fully controlled on five key control criteria. Moreover, 40% of the comparisons had at least one confound related to instructional method and content. When looking at the outcomes of the studies, it was difficult to gather a clear picture of the benefits or pitfalls of IVR when much of the literature was confounded and/or lacked sufficient information to determine if the conditions were controlled on key variables. Implications and recommendations for future IVR comparison research are discussed.
Tutor CoPilot: A Human-AI Approach for Scaling Real-Time Expertise. EdWorkingPaper No. 24-1054;"Wang, Rose E.; Ribeiro, Ana T.; Robinson, Carly D.; Loeb, Susanna; Demszky, Dorottya";2024;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;Generative AI, particularly Language Models (LMs), has the potential to transform real-world domains with societal impact, particularly where access to experts is limited. For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately hurts students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education and are most likely to be taught by inexperienced educators. We introduce Tutor CoPilot, a novel Human-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study presents the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working on mathematics with tutors randomly assigned to have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. relative to the control group. We find that Tutor CoPilot costs only $20 per-tutor annually, based on the tutors' usage during the study. We analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use strategies that foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student, aligning with high-quality teaching practices. Tutor interviews qualitatively highlight how Tutor CoPilot's guidance helps them to respond to student needs, though tutors flag common issues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, our study of Tutor CoPilot demonstrates how Human-AI systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students.

Introducing Students to Machine Learning with Decision Trees Using CODAP and Jupyter NoteBooks;"Biehler, Rolf; Fleischer, Yannik";2021;Teaching Statistics: An International  Journal for Teachers;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12279;Yes;;;;"This paper Reports on progress in the development of a teaching module on machine learning with decision trees for secondary-school students, in which students use survey data about media use to predict who plays online games frequently. This context is familiar to students and provides a link between school and everyday experience. In this module, they use CODAP's ""Arbor"" plug-in to manually build decision trees and understand how to systematically build trees based on data. Further on, the students use a menu-based environment in a Jupyter NoteBook to apply an algorithm that automatically generates decision trees and to evaluate and optimize the performance of these. Students acquire technical and conceptual skills but also reflect on personal and social aspects of the uses of algorithms from machine learning."
ALEKS in High School Mathematics Classrooms: Exploring Teachers' Perceptions and Use of This Tool;"Kumor, Tristan; Uribe-Flórez, Lida; Trespalacios, Jesús; Yang, Dazhi";2024;TechTrends: Linking Research and Practice to Improve Learning;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-024-00955-0;Yes;;;;There has been a limited amount of research that has attempted to determine teaching strategies using adaptive learning systems. Most studies have attempted to measure success of the use of these technologies based on improvements in students' test scores but have lacked to provide any information regarding the pedagogy implemented while using the tool or teachers' perceptions of it. A basic qualitative study was conducted where five Chicagoland high school mathematics teachers, who used the Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) system, were interviewed three times during one academic school year. This study asked participants to share first-hand experiences and perceptions of using ALEKS as the main learning tool. Teachers used ALEKS for assessing student understanding through its quizzes and assignments, analyzing student progress, and allowing students to practice and receive feedback on mathematical concepts. The findings of this study indicate that teachers found ALEKS to be easy to use and useful in their teaching. Specifically, teachers cited the assessment tools, built-in feedback, ability to personalize learning, and the accessibility of learning tools for students as useful in their teaching.

Supporting the Integrated Learning of Science, Engineering, and Computational Thinking in an Open-Ended Learning Environment;Zhang, Ningyu;2020;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Recently there has been a call among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers for the integration of science and engineering education in K-12 curricula. Similarly, computational thinking (CT) has been recognized as a framework for developing computer literacy and computing skills among the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) communities. Meanwhile, open-ended learning environments (OELEs) and artificial intelligence methods are being used extensively to facilitate meaningful and personalized learning. This study investigates the effectiveness of an OELE to support middle school students' integrated learning of science, engineering, and CT. Using a principled domain-specific modeling language, we designed and implemented an OELE and an earth sciences curriculum that supports this form of integrated learning. CT concepts and practices are instantiated through computational modeling activities, where students build computational models of the runoff phenomenon in urban environments and then use the developed models to solve an engineering task of designing a schoolyard to minimize water runoff while also satisfying the design criteria of cost and accessibility. A teacher-led classroom study was run with 99 sixth-grade students, and the data collected consists of students' summative and formative assessments, as well as log data of their activities on the OELE. Our results show that (1) the participants achieved significant learning gains in science, engineering design, and CT concepts and practices; (2) the participants' learning behaviors and performance across different domains influenced each other in a positive way; and (3) the participants' learning strategies can be linked to their learning performances. This work has made important advances to integrated science and engineering education. In future work, we plan to extend this curriculum and provide feedback within the OELE to help students become better learners.

AI ChatBots' Solutions to Mathematical Problems in Interactive E-TextBooks: Affordances and Constraints from the Eyes of Students and Teachers;"Ergene, Ozkan; Ergene, Busra Caylan";2025;Education and Information Technologies;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-13121-z;Yes;;;;One of the aims of the present study was to reveal and compare the performance of ChatGPT versions (GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5), MathGPT, and Gemini in solving 390 mathematical problems in interactive mathematics e-textBooks across various dimensions. The other aim was to identify the affordances and constraints of ChatGPT through the instrumental approach. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. The participants were 160 high school students and 80 mathematics teachers. Data were collected through the evaluation forms, view forms, and interviews with students and teachers based on ChatGPT's solutions to the mathematical problems. The findings showed that the success rates of GPT-4o and GPT-4 were close to each other, with a slightly higher success rate of GPT-4o. This was followed by MathGPT and GPT-3.5. Gemini has the lowest success rate among the AI chatbots. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical problems, a statistically significant difference between the number of correct and incorrect solutions was found in all ChatGPT versions but not in MathGPT and Gemini. Furthermore, teachers and students referred to explanatory and detailed aspects of the solutions, learning without a teacher, getting solutions directly and quickly, and learning support as affordances of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the participants also acknowledged the constraints of ChatGPT while being aware of its affordances. Based on students' and teachers' expressions in the view forms and interviews, the mean scores they provided in the evaluation forms, and ChatGPT's high performance in solving mathematical problems, it is suggested that ChatGPT could be a useful tool for students' individual mathematics learning process.

The Emergence of Computational Thinking in National Mathematics Curricula: An Australian Example;Whitney-Smith, Rachael Margaret;2023;Journal of Pedagogical Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;As we move further into the digital age, the acquisition of digital literacy (DL) and computational thinking (CT) skills is emerging internationally as an essential goal for students in contemporary school curricula. As the world becomes more uncertain and volatile due to impacts of artificial intelligence (AI), international unrest, climate change, global economic instability and unforeseen catastrophes such as the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to review, revise and refine school education curricula and policies. The issue of what is essential for students to learn, and how they learn it, is of growing importance to international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and is emerging as a significant driver for educational reform across the globe. The growing prominence of CT and DL skills across many industry sectors has prompted recent changes to international assessment frameworks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper will briefly discuss specific examples of alternative approaches to addressing CT in national curricula for the compulsory years of schooling and explain how CT has been adopted as a driver for mathematics curriculum change in Australia.
"""Gea2"": A Serious Game for Technology-Enhanced Learning in STEM";"Ferro, Lauren S.; Sapio, Francesco; Terracina, Annalisa; Temperini, Marco; Mecella, Massimo";2021;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2022.3143519;Yes;;;;Education and training are among the fields taking advantage of serious games (SGs). In this article, we present Gea 2: A New Earth, a digital SG developed as an immersive 3-D virtual learning environment, integrating several educational resources, including multimedia learning material, communication tools, and intelligent tutoring support. The game aims to complement traditional classroom activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), for high school students and teachers. It incorporates an intelligent pedagogical agent that can converse in natural language with the student and provides unsolicited hints during gameplay. This article presents the game and its evaluation based on experiments involving about 100 participants. We think that the results presented here add to the research on game-based learning for STEM, by proposing a complex game system, where artificial intelligence techniques are integrated to support students' learning, and by confirming that the game experience can be attractive for the learners, also in very constrained classroom environments, such as those we operated in.
Application of Locally Developed Smart Learning Environments in the Teaching of Mathematics in Public Secondary Schools in Osun State, Nigeria;"Oteyola, Temitope; Akintitan, Oluyemisi; Oyeniran, Oyetola";2023;International Journal of Education and Development using Information and Communication Technology;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Challenges of teaching Mathematics include inadequate teachers, over reliance on the talk and chalk method of teaching and inadequate use of instructional materials. These resulted in poor academic performance among secondary school students in Osun State, Nigeria. This study therefore determined the effect of locally developed smart learning environments on secondary school students' academic achievement in Mathematics and if there is significant interaction between sex and the modes of teaching. The study employed pretest posttest control nonequivalent group design. Seventy five (75) students were selected across a randomly selected senatorial district in the state using a multistage sampling procedure. A Mathematics Achievement Test (MAT) was used at the pretest and the posttest. Items with IDI > 0.3 were removed during validation. Content Validity Ratio ([alpha] = 1) was also obtained for the remaining 20 items in the achievement test. Analysis of data showed no significant difference in the academic achievement of students exposed to the SLE and those taught with the talk and chalk method (F[subscript (1,74)] = 0.05 ; p = 0.83). Results also showed that the interaction between sex and the mode of instruction is not significant (F[subscript (1,74)] = 0.21 ; p = 0.65)."
Machine Learning Algorithm for Grading Open-Ended Physics Questions in Turkish;"Çinar, Ayse; Ince, Elif; Gezer, Murat; Yilmaz, Özgür";2020;Education and Information Technologies;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Worldwide, open-ended questions that require short answers have been used in many exams in fields of science, such as the International Student Assessment Program (PISA), the International Science and Maths Trends Research (TIMSS). However, multiple-choice questions are used for many exams at the national level in Turkey, especially high school and university entrance exams. This study aims to develop an objective and useful automatic scoring model for open-ended questions using machine learning algorithms. Within the scope of this aim, an automated scoring model construction study was conducted on four Physics questions at a University level course with the participation of 246 undergraduate students. The short-answer scoring was handled through an approach that addresses students' answers in Turkish. Model performing machine learning classification techniques such as SVM (Support Vector Machines), Gini, KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), and Bagging and Boosting were applied after data preprocessing. The score indicated the accuracy, precision and F1-Score of each predictive model of which the AdaBoost.M1 technique had the best performance. In this paper, we Report on a short answer grading system in Turkish, based on a machine learning approach using a constructed dataset about a Physics course in Turkish. This study is also the first study in the field of open-ended exam scoring in Turkish.
Exploring the Use of Artificial Intelligent Systems in STEM Classrooms;Kornyo, Emmanuel Anthony;2021;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Human beings by nature have a predisposition towards learning and the exploration of the natural world. We are intrinsically intellectual and social beings knitted with adaptive cognitive architectures. As Foot (2014) succinctly sums it up: ""humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions"" and they ""… make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate"" and ""community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning--and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting"" (p.3). Education remains pivotal in the transmission of social values including language, knowledge, science, technology, and an avalanche of others. Indeed, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have been significant to the advancement of social cultures transcending every epoch to contemporary times. As Jasanoff (2004) poignantly observed, ""the ways in which we know and represent the world (both nature and society) are inseparable from the ways in which we choose to live in it. […] Scientific knowledge [..] both embeds and is embedded in social practices, identities, norms, conventions, discourses, instruments, and institutions"" (p.2-3). In essence, science remains both a tacit and an explicit cultural activity through which human beings explore their own world, discover nature, create knowledge and technology towards their progress and existence. This has been possible through the interaction and applications of artifacts, tools, and technologies within the purviews of their environments. The applications of technologies are found across almost every luster of organizational learning especially teacher education, STEM, architecture, manufacturing, and a flurry of others. Thus, human evolution and development are inexplicably linked with education either formally or informally. The 21st century has however seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies in education. The proliferation of artificial intelligence and associated technologies are creating new overtures of digital multiculturalism with distinct worldviews of significance to education. For example, learners are demonstrating digital literacy skills and are knowledgeable about AI technologies across every specter of their lives (Bennett et al., 2008). It is also opening new artesian well-springs of educational opportunities and pedagogical applications. This includes mapping new methodological pathways, content creation and curriculum design, career preparations and indeed a seemingly new paradigm shift in teaching STEM. There is growing scholarly evidence about the use and diffusion of these technologies in K-12 and higher education (Bonk & Graham, 2012; Hew & Brush, 2007; Langer, 2018; Mishra & Koehler, 2006). Some of these include the Sphero robots, Micro Bit, Jill Watson, ""BrickPi3 Classroom kit"", ""Engino STEM Mechanic"", ""Lego Education WeDo Core Set"" and Spike. Both educators and learners are using these in STEM programs as well as other education related activities. Just as human activities and interactions with artifacts and tools shaped and redefined the scientific-technological feat of previous generations, so the contemporary digital technological era seems to be on a similar trajectory. However, there is sparsity of empirical scholarship on the pedagogical prospects and effectiveness of artificial intelligence in STEM classrooms. Also, it should be noted that scholarship on how AI impacts pedagogical content knowledge of STEM educators and how learners perceive these technologies are just emerging. In addition, the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Ghandhi et al., 2020; Rasmussen et al., 2020) has unexpectedly created a renewed synergy towards the applications of digital technologies in teaching STEM. In the context of this ""force majeure"" (COVID-19), the traditional brick and mortar educational spaces metamorphosed into digital spaces with the applications of many artificial intelligent technologies and resources in the arena of education. This doctoral dissertation study examined these enigmas including how educators use these technologies in STEM classrooms. The study is informed by ""activity theory or cultural-historical activity theory"" (Engestro¨m et al., 2007; Hasan et al., 2014; Krinski & Barker, 2009; Oers, 2010; Vygotsky,1987). The study participants will be selected from educators currently integrating artificial intelligent systems and digital technologies in their respective STEM classrooms. Pre-data survey inquiry has shown that many educators were incorporating some forms of AIS into their STEM classrooms. In view of these, I have explored Sphero educational robots to interrogate the research topic. The Sphero Edu described as a ""…STEAM-based toolset that weaves hardware, software, and community engagement to promote 21st century skills. While these skills are absolutely crucial, our edu program goes beyond code by nurturing students' creativity and ingenuity like no other education program can"" (Sphero, April 2020). The Sphero robots also have features and applications for designing and teaching STEM topics such as nature, space science, geometry, and other activities of pedagogical significance. Users could also design and write advanced engineering programs in JavaScript during STEM educational activities formally and outside of the classrooms. In essence, educators and students can learn designing, programming, engineering, mathematics, computational thinking, and hands-on skills reflective of the 21st century. In brief, the dissertation study research has explored artificial intelligence and emerging technologies and how these could transform and advance teaching and learning of STEM hence the research topic: ""Exploring the use of Artificial Intelligent Systems in STEM Classrooms."" Methodologically, this is a qualitative study through the theoretical frameworks of ""activity theory"" as applicable to STEM education. The main research questions are: 1) ""Given that artificial intelligent systems and digital technologies"" have been applied in STEM educational domains (content, pedagogy, student learning, assessment). How does the application of AIS and digital technologies impact pedagogy in STEM educational activities? 2) Given that digital technology is transforming contemporary society in every facet. How/What does AIS tell us about how digital technology impacts STEM pedagogy? Data was collected from the study participants, archival sources, and others for analyses. It is hoped that the findings will inform and address theories of learning and teaching, policy and praxis in science education, teacher preparatory and professional development programs as it relates to STEM classrooms.

Examining Key Capitals Contributing to Students' Science-Related Career Expectations and Their Relationship Patterns: A Machine Learning Approach;"Tan, Lihua; Chen, Fu; Wei, Bing";2024;Journal of Research in Science Teaching;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21939;Yes;;;;"Through the lens of science capital, this research aims to detect the key factors and their main effects in identifying students with science-related career expectations. A machine learning approach (i.e., random forest) was employed to analyze a dataset of 519,334 15-year-old students from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. The global analysis identified 25 key factors out of 88 contextual features: (1) for ""how you think,"" making students feel science is relevant, enjoyable, and interesting is relatively more crucial than being ambitious and confident; (2) for ""what science you know,"" students' science and math literacy, epistemological beliefs, and awareness of environmental matters were the key factors; (3) for ""who you know,"" parents valuing science, expecting their children to enter science, and providing emotional support were as similar as or even more important than their economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS)-related constructs, while teachers fairness ranked the top among all teaching-related features; and (4) for ""what you do,"" appropriate science learning time, engagement in science activities, and ICT use for schoolwork were key factors. These findings indicate a relatively optimistic situation, as the most key capitals were malleable for educators. Accumulated local effect plots further discriminated how these key capitals related to students' career expectations in four distinct ways: ""increasing,"" ""S-shaped,"" ""inverted-U-shaped,"" and ""decreasing,"" shedding light on how we could optimize key resources to enhance aspirations. The comparison between global and Hong Kong analyses suggests the key factors identified by the global model were generally effective but not necessarily essential for a specific region. The cross-cultural generalizability or prevalence of capitals might vary by their forms."
What Makes Tablet-Based Learning Effective? A Study of the Role of Real-Time Adaptive Feedback;"Colliot, Tiphaine; Krichen, Omar; Girard, Nathalie; Anquetil, Éric; Jamet, Éric";2024;British Journal of Educational Technology;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13439;Yes;;;;This study investigated the added value of real-time adaptive feedback on seventh graders' performances in tablet-based geometry learning. To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance. Our data therefore indicate that artificial intelligence is a promising way of providing learners with real-time adaptive feedback in order to improve their performances.
Predictors of Early Postsecondary STEM Persistence of High-Achieving Students: An Explanatory Study Using Machine Learning Techniques;Karakis, Nesibe;2021;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study investigated high-achieving and non-high-achieving students' persistence in STEM fields using nationally representative data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 for the years 2009, 2012, 2013, 2013-2014, and 2016. The results indicated that approximately 70% of high-achieving and non-high-achieving students continued their initial STEM degrees within 3 years of college enrollment. The study revealed that the most important predictors of STEM persistence were: math proficiency level, school belonging, school engagement, school motivation, school problems, science self-efficacy, credits earned in computer sciences, GPA in STEM courses, credits earned in STEM courses, and credits earned in Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) courses. Based on the results, math proficiency was the most important variable in the study for both high-achieving and non-high-achieving students. Even though credits earned in AP/IB combined were among the most important variables, they were two times more important for high-achieving students (6.86% vs. 3.37%). Regarding demographic information related variables, socioeconomic status was the most important variable among gender, ethnicity, and urbanicity in models predicting STEM persistence and had higher importance for non-high-achieving students. Furthermore, Hispanic students' proportion of persistence differed from other underrepresented populations' persistence. Non-high-achieving Hispanic students had the highest persistence rate, similar to well-represented populations (i.e., White, Asian). Machine learning methods used in the study including random forest and artificial neural network provided good accuracy for both achievement groups. Random forest accuracy was over 82% with the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) dataset, while artificial neural network accuracy was over 92%.

An Online STEM Program for Gifted Students of Color Amidst COVID-19;Watson, Crystal;2023;Journal of STEM Outreach;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"There is a need to expand the pool of talented science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) professionals who come from underrepresented backgrounds. The W.E.B. Du Bois Scholars Institute's Accelerated Learning Academy (ALA), which operated as a three-weekend online STEM program in 2021, provided high-achieving tenth, eleventh and twelfth graders from underserved communities the opportunity to participate in interactive online STEM workshops within one of four ALA STEM tracks: Applied Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Technology, Medical Science or Biomedical Engineering and Technology. The weekend workshops consisted of STEM guest presentations, a combination of lecture and interactive group activities for practical application, and ""New Thinking'' workshops to foster collaboration in exploring methods to address contemporary STEM issues. In this paper, I describe attributes of the ALA program that was configured for the online environment and the survey data reflecting students' responses to the program. Survey results showed a heightened awareness of STEM careers after participating in the workshops and an increase in STEM knowledge and skills. Furthermore, survey results indicated that students derived high value in the online workshops' curriculum, working with other participants, and learning from experienced STEM professionals."
Domain-Specific Modeling Languages in Computer-Based Learning Environments: A Systematic Approach to Support Science Learning through Computational Modeling;"Hutchins, Nicole M.; Biswas, Gautam; Zhang, Ningyu; Snyder, Caitlin; Lédeczi, Ákos; Maróti, Miklós";2020;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Driven by our technologically advanced workplaces and the surge in demand for proficiency in the computing disciplines, it is becoming imperative to provide computational thinking (CT) opportunities to all students. One approach for making computing accessible and relevant to learning and problem-solving in K-12 environments is to integrate it with existing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) curricula. However, novice student learners may face several difficulties in trying to learn STEM and computing concepts simultaneously. To address some of these difficulties, we present a systematic approach to learning STEM and CT by designing and developing ""domain-specific modeling languages"" (DSMLs) to aid students in their model building and problem-solving processes. The paper discusses a theoretical framework and the design principles for developing DSMLs, which is implemented as a four-step process. We apply the four-step process in three domains: Physics, Marine Biology, and Earth Science to demonstrate its generality, and then perform case studies to show how the DSMLs impact student learning and model building. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and then present directions for future work."
Application of Neighborhood Components Analysis to Process and Survey Data to Predict Student Learning of Statistics;"Lu, Yikai; Ober, Teresa M.; Liu, Cheng; Cheng, Ying";2022;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;Machine learning methods for predictive analytics have great potential for uncovering trends in educational data. However, simple linear models still appear to be most widely used, in part, because of their interpretability. This study aims to address the issues of interpretability of complex machine learning classifiers by conducting feature extraction by neighborhood components analysis (NCA). Our dataset comprises 287 features from both process data indicators (i.e., derived from log data of an online statistics learning platform) and self-Report data from high school students enrolled in Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics (N=733). As a label for prediction, we use students' scores on the AP Statistics exam. We evaluated the performance of machine learning classifiers with a given feature extraction method by evaluation criteria including F1 scores, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and Cohen's Kappas. We find that NCA effectively reduces the dimensionality of training datasets, stabilizes machine learning predictions, and produces interpretable scores. However, interpreting the NCA weights of features, while feasible, is not very straightforward compared to linear regression. Future research should consider developing guidelines to interpret NCA weights.
Essays in Labor Economics;Ng, Kevin Christopher;2022;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;This dissertation is comprised of three essays, each examining a different topic in labor economics. In Chapter 1, I examine the productivity and selection effects of K-12 teacher tenure by leveraging variation from New Jersey's TEACHNJ Act. This law extended the pre-tenure period from three to four years and allowed districts to dismiss consistently low-performing teachers. I use multiple identification strategies to estimate the productivity effects of tenure across a teacher's career. I evaluate the productivity effects at tenure receipt using a difference-in-differences design, which compares fourth-year tenured and pre-tenured teachers. At tenure receipt, math value-added declines but English language arts value-added and summative ratings remain unchanged. To estimate the productivity effects later in the career, I use a regression discontinuity design relying on discontinuities in job security around summative rating thresholds. Later in the career, tenure has no impact on productivity. Thus, tenure induces a transitory decline in math value-added without impacting other dimensions of teacher performance. Focusing on the labor market effects, I compare teachers hired before and after TEACHNJ within the same district and experience level. The TEACHNJ Act disproportionately increased male and Black teacher turnover rates. TEACHNJ did not impact the quality of the teacher labor market as measured by value-added, though higher rated teachers often filled new vacancies. Since the TEACHNJ Act only relies on summative ratings to make personnel decisions, this result aligns with a multitask principal-agent model where only one of several measures of performance is used to evaluate the employee. In Chapter 2, I evaluate techniques to identify high-quality teachers. Since tenure restricts dismissals of experienced teachers, schools must predict productivity and dismiss those expected to perform ineffectively prior to tenure receipt. Many states solely rely on evaluation scores to guide these personnel decisions without considering other dimensions of teacher performance. For example, New Jersey uses summative ratings, which primarily rely on supervisor evaluations. I use various predictive models to rank teachers based on predicted value-added and summative ratings. I then simulate revised personnel decisions and test for changes in average retained teacher performance. In this exercise, I adjust two factors that impact the quality of the predictions: the number of predictors and the length of the pre-tenure period. Both factors impact the precision of the predictions, though extended pre-tenure periods also may negatively impact selection into teaching. I find that revised algorithms using both value-added and summative ratings increase the average value-added of retained teachers by 0.01 standard deviations without decreasing summative ratings or diversity. This Pareto improvement equates to a present value gain of $2,240 per student. These returns are a product of using additional information rather than advanced algorithms, as I generate similar gains when using simple ordinary least squares regressions or advanced machine learning techniques. In comparison, algorithms that extend the pre-tenure period beyond one year do not provide enough additional information to significantly improve average retained teacher performance unless dismissal rates increase dramatically. In Chapter 3, my coauthor and I examine how returns to enrolling in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs vary with students' academic preparation. We match data on STEM admissions at a Colombian flagship university to nationwide college and earnings records. Our identification strategy combines a regression discontinuity design with variation in admission quotas. We find that less-prepared students were less likely to complete a STEM degree than their more able peers, but they had larger earnings returns to enrolling. Our results suggest that policies that encourage less-prepared students to enroll in STEM programs can yield large but unevenly distributed earnings gains.

Revolutionizing Pre-Calculus Education: Photomath's AI-Powered Mathematics Tutorship;Capinding, Andie Tangonan;2023;Problems of Education in the 21st Century;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Mathematics plays a vital role in education; however, Filipino students encounter difficulties, evident in their performance on both national and international assessments. However, current literature suggests that leveraging technology, such as calculators and AI, in mathematics education can enhance students' proficiency, particularly in the pre-calculus domain. Thus, this research study examined the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing Filipino students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. A quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was used, with 49 Grade 11 students from NEUST Laboratory High School participating. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to examine the pre-and post-intervention data. Results revealed a significant increase in students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus following the use of Photomath. The mean scores on all three measures increased significantly from the pretest to the posttest. The results of the t-tests further confirmed the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. These results suggest that Photomath can be a valuable tool for educators to incorporate into pre-calculus teaching to enhance students' confidence and interest, foster intrinsic motivation, and ultimately improve their performance."
Teaching Plan Generation and Evaluation with GPT-4: Unleashing the Potential of LLM in Instructional Design;"Hu, Bihao; Zheng, Longwei; Zhu, Jiayi; Ding, Lishan; Wang, Yilei; Gu, Xiaoqing";2024;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study explores and analyzes the specific performance of large language models (LLMs) in instructional design, aiming to unveil their potential strengths and possible weaknesses. Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.
Three Algorithms for Grouping Students: A Bridge between Personalized Tutoring System Data and Classroom Pedagogy;"Lechuga, Christopher G.; Doroudi, Shayan";2023;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00309-y;Yes;;;;Computer-assisted instructional programs such as intelligent tutoring systems are often used to support blended learning practices in K-12 education, as they aim to meet individual student needs with personalized instruction. While these systems have been shown to be effective under certain conditions, they can be difficult to integrate into pedagogical practices. In this paper, we introduce three group formation algorithms that leverage learning data from the adaptive intelligent tutoring system ALEKS to support pedagogical and collaborative learning practices with ALEKS. Each grouping method was devised for different use cases, but they all utilize a fine-grained multidimensional view of student ability measured across several hundred skills in an academic course. As such, the grouping algorithms not only identify groups of students, but they also determine what areas of ALEKS content each group should focus on. We then evaluate each of the three methods against two alternative baseline methods, which were chosen for their plausibility of being used in practice--one that groups students randomly and one that groups students based on a unidimensional course score. To evaluate these methods, we establish a set of practical metrics based on what we anticipate teachers would care about in practice. Evaluations were performed by simulating mock groupings of students at different time periods for real ALEKS algebra classes that occurred between 2017 and 2019. We show that each devised method obtains more favorable results on the specified metrics than the alternative methods under each use-case. Moreover, we highlight examples where our methods lead to more nuanced groupings than grouping based on a unidimensional measure of ability.
A Machine Learning Approach to Investigating the Effects of Mathematics Dispositions on Mathematical Literacy;"Gabriel, Florence; Signolet, Jason; Westwell, Martin";2018;International Journal of Research & Method in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Mathematics competency is fast becoming an essential requirement in ever greater parts of day-to-day work and life. Thus, creating strategies for improving mathematics learning in students is a major goal of education research. However, doing so requires an ability to look at many aspects of mathematics learning, such as demographics and psychological dispositions, in an integrated way as part of the same system. Large-scale assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) provide an accessible and large volume of coherent data, and this gives researchers the opportunity to employ data-driven approaches to gain an overview of the system. For these reasons, we have used machine learning to explore the relationships between psychological dispositions and mathematical literacy in Australian 15-year-olds using the PISA 2012 data set. Our results from this strongly data-driven approach re-affirm the primacy of mathematics self-efficacy and highlight novel complex interactions between mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and socio-economic status. In this paper, we demonstrate how education researchers can usefully employ data-driven modelling techniques to find complex non-linear relationships and novel interactions in a multidimensional data set.
Designing a Teachable Agent System for Mathematics Learning;Song, Donggil;2017;Contemporary Educational Technology;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Learning-by-teaching has been identified as one of the more effective approaches to learning. Recently, educational researchers have investigated virtual environments in order to utilize the learning-by-teaching pedagogy. In a face-to-face learning-by-teaching situation, the role of the learners is to teach their peers or instructors. In virtual environments, learners take an active role by teaching a computer agent, which is referred to as Teachable Agent (TA). Although the current TA systems have shown their effectiveness on students' learning, there are some challenges associated with learner-computer interaction methods. One of the most popular interaction methods between the learner and the system is a concept map approach. The learner teaches TA by creating information structures by drawing and editing their concept map. However, the learner can teach TA rather constrained topics, such as concept-related materials or causal effects. It is difficult for TA systems to be utilized in different types of learning along with concept-related areas. Therefore, new approaches or methods for communication between a human learner and TA systems are required. This project aims to suggest a virtual learning-by-teaching environment. A communication method (i.e., a symbol manipulation approach) was adopted in this system. The method facilitates the interaction between the learner and the computer agent, specifically for K-12 students' mathematics learning. The design and development process is described, and future research areas are discussed.
An Important Component to Investigating STEM Persistence: The Development and Validation of the Science Identity (SciID) Scale;"Lockhart, Mary Elizabeth; Kwok, Oi-Man; Yoon, Myeongsun; Wong, Raymond";2022;International Journal of STEM Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;Yes;Yes;"Background: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) influence almost every aspect of our daily lives. However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. ""Science identity"" has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as Reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students' science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results: Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach's alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions: Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student's standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students' science identity."
Facilitating Student Learning with a Chatbot in an Online Math Learning Platform;"Cheng, Li; Croteau, Ethan; Baral, Sami; Heffernan, Cristina; Heffernan, Neil";2024;Journal of Educational Computing Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Chatbots represent a promising technology for engaging students in math learning. Guided by Jerome Bruner's constructivism and Lev Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development, we designed and developed a chatbot that incorporates scaffolding strategies and social-emotional considerations, and we integrated it into ASSISTments, an online math learning platform. We conducted an experimental study to examine the influence of learning math with the chatbot compared to traditional learning with hints. This study involved 85 middle and high school students from three diverse school settings in the United States. The results revealed no significant differences in students' math learning performance and perceived helpfulness and interest between the chatbot and traditional hints conditions. However, students in the chatbot condition displayed significantly lower confidence in solving a similar problem after the intervention, likely due to the removal of the high level of support provided by the chatbot. Despite this, students' open responses indicated that a significantly higher number of students had positive attitudes towards chatbots. They appreciated the chatting feature, breaking down a problem into steps, and real-time support. The study concludes with a discussion of the findings and implications for chatbot designers and developers and presents avenues for future research and practice in chatbot-assisted learning. In support of Open Science, this study has been preregistered and both the data and the analysis code used in this study are publicly available at https://osf.io/am3p8/.
An Artificial Intelligence-Based Distance Education System: Artimat;"Nabiyev, Vasif; Karal, Hasan; Arslan, Selahattin; Erumit, Ali Kursat; Cebi, Ayca";2013;Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the artificial intelligence-based distance education system called ARTIMAT, which has been prepared in order to improve mathematical problem solving skills of the students, in terms of conceptual proficiency and ease of use with the opinions of teachers and students. The implementation has been performed with 4 teachers and 59 students in 10th grade in an Anatolian High School in Trabzon. Many institutions and organizations in the world approach seriously to distance education besides traditional education. It is inevitable to use the distance education in teaching the problem solving skills in this different dimension of the education. In the studies in Turkey and abroad in the field of mathematics teaching, problem solving skills are generally stated not to be at the desired level and often expressed to have difficulty in teaching. For this reason, difficulties of the students in problem solving have initially been evaluated and the system has been prepared utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms according to the obtained results. In the evaluation of the findings obtained from the application, it has been concluded that the system is responsive to the needs of the students and is successful in general, but that conceptual changes should be made in order that students adapt to the system quickly.

Indonesian Students' Perceptions towards AI-Based Learning in Mathematics;"Soesanto, Robert Harry; Dirgantoro, Kurnia Putri Sepdikasari; Priyantim, Neng";2022;Journal on Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.22342/jme.v13i3.pp531-548;Yes;;;;The pandemic has indeed provided students and teachers worldwide with the experience of technology-infused teaching. Even though the pandemic is almost over, the utilization of technology in mathematics education is still needed and inseparable. Relying on cross-sectional design and phenomenological approach, this research investigates senior high school students' perceptions towards AI-based learning, particularly about their understanding and suggestions towards AI-based learning in mathematics in the context of post-pandemic. The participants of the study were 107 students coming from several islands in Indonesia, ranging from grade 10-12, with an age interval of 15-18 years old. The instruments used were the questionaries with open-ended questions in Microsoft forms distributed to mathematics teachers in several WhatsApp groups. The data were then analyzed through a multistage descriptive and pattern coding process. The findings showed that students need to be facilitated with AI, which can display understandable visualization and provide guidance to solve mathematical problems. It is expected that the present study's findings offer researchers in Indonesia and abroad to disseminate and/or implement AI learning in the form of Intelligent Tutoring Systems.
Combining Machine Translation and Automated Scoring in International Large-Scale Assessments;"Jung, Ji Yoon; Tyack, Lillian; Davier, Matthias von";2024;Large-scale Assessments in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1186/s40536-024-00199-7;Yes;;;;Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing communication and technology-driven content creation and is also being used more frequently in education. Despite these advancements, AI-powered automated scoring in international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) remains largely unexplored due to the scoring challenges associated with processing large amounts of multilingual responses. However, due to their low-stakes nature, ILSAs are an ideal ground for innovations and exploring new methodologies. Methods: This study proposes combining state-of-the-art machine translations (i.e., Google Translate & ChatGPT) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mitigate two key concerns of human scoring: inconsistency and high expense. We applied AI-based automated scoring to multilingual student responses from eight countries and six different languages, using six constructed response items from TIMSS 2019. Results: Automated scoring displayed comparable performance to human scoring, especially when the ANNs were trained and tested on ChatGPT-translated responses. Furthermore, psychometric characteristics derived from machine scores generally exhibited similarity to those obtained from human scores. These results can be considered as supportive evidence for the validity of automated scoring for survey assessments. Conclusions: This study highlights that automated scoring integrated with the recent machine translation holds great promise for consistent and resource-efficient scoring in ILSAs.
Predicting Secondary School Students' Performance Utilizing a Semi-Supervised Learning Approach;"Livieris, Ioannis E.; Drakopoulou, Konstantina; Tampakas, Vassilis T.; Mikropoulos, Tassos A.; Pintelas, Panagiotis";2019;Journal of Educational Computing Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Educational data mining constitutes a recent research field which gained popularity over the last decade because of its ability to monitor students' academic performance and predict future progression. Numerous machine learning techniques and especially supervised learning algorithms have been applied to develop accurate models to predict student's characteristics which induce their behavior and performance. In this work, we examine and evaluate the effectiveness of two wrapper methods for semisupervised learning algorithms for predicting the students' performance in the final examinations. Our preliminary numerical experiments indicate that the advantage of semisupervised methods is that the classification accuracy can be significantly improved by utilizing a few labeled and many unlabeled data for developing reliable prediction models.
Chatbot Application in a 5th Grade Science Course;"Deveci Topal, Arzu; Dilek Eren, Canan; Geçer, Aynur Kolburan";2021;Education and Information Technologies;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study aims to investigate the effect of chatbots that work with artificial intelligence on the success of students and their opinions about chatbots in the 'Matter and the changing state of matter' unit in the 5th grade science course. In addition to text-based functions, the designed chatbot includes a video accessed on the web to support students visually and aurally. The chatbot was designed using the Dialogflow program and an instant messaging program made available to students through a group created on Telegram. The study, which used a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, included 41 participants (n = 20 for the experimental, n = 21 for the control group) studying in the 5th grade of a state secondary school in the 2020-2021 academic year. Results suggest that although there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of academic achievement, it was determined that the chatbot application positively affected the online learning experience of the experimental group students. Students' opinions about the chatbot included that it was useful and fun, they would like to use it for other courses, it provided useful assistance in learning outside the classroom, and it allowed them to repeat the course again. The results showed that, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, such applications could contribute positively to students' learning.
Teaching Algebraic Model Construction: A Tutoring System, Lessons Learned and an Evaluation;"VanLehn, Kurt; Banerjee, Chandrani; Milner, Fabio; Wetzel, Jon";2020;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;An algebraic model uses a set of algebra equations to precisely describe a situation. Constructing such models is a fundamental skill required by US standards for both math and science. It is usually taught with algebra word problems. However, many students still lack the skill, even after taking several algebra courses in high school and college. We are developing a short, intensive course in algebraic model construction. The course combines human teaching with a tutoring system. This paper describes the lessons learned during the iterative development process. Starting from an existing theory of model construction, we gradually acquired a completely different view of the skills required as we modified the tutoring system and the instruction. We close by describing encouraging results from a quasi-experimental study.
Presenting the Regression Tree Method and Its Application in a Large-Scale Educational Dataset;"Gomes, Cristiano Mauro Assis; Jelihovschi, Enio";2020;International Journal of Research & Method in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Regression Tree Method is not yet a mainstream method in Education, despite of being a traditional approach in Machine Learning. We advocate that this method should become mainstream in Education, since, in our point of view, it is the most suitable method to analyse complex datasets, very common in Education. This is, for example, the case of educational governmental large-scale databases, in particular those where the information: (1) have large quantity and types of variables; (2) exhibit many categorical variables with many categories; (3) have many non-linear relationships among variables; (4) are guided or supported by management goals, instead of a specific theory. In this paper we show its rationale, focusing on the Classification And Regression Trees algorithm (CART). We also apply this algorithm to a complex large-scale educational dataset, the microdata of the National Examination for Secondary Education (Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio [ENEM]). Our general goal is to disseminate the use of the Regression Tree Method in Education, particularly in complex datasets and on the substantial and interpretative aspects of this method."
Compendium of Education Technology Research Funded by NCER and NCSER: 2002-2014. NCER 2017-0001;"Yamaguchi, Ryoko; Hall, Adam";2017;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Between 2002 and 2014, the Institute of Education Sciences (Institute) supported over 400 projects focused on education technology through the National Center for Education Research (NCER) and the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER). The majority of this work has been funded through Education Technology research topics of NCER and NCSER and the Institute's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program run by NCER. Both centers also support projects focusing on education technology through other research topic areas, including programs such as Cognition and Student Learning, Early Learning Programs and Policies, Math and Science, Reading and Writing, Social and Behavioral Context, Improving Education Systems, and Effective Teachers and Teaching. Together, researchers funded by NCER and NCSER have developed or studied more than 270 web-based tools, 85 virtual environments and interactive simulations, 95 intelligent tutor and artificial intelligence software systems, 50 game-based tools, and 105 computer-based assessments. This compendium organizes information on the education technology projects sponsored by NCER and NCSER into three main sections: (1) Technology to Support Student Learning (in which the target of the project was students themselves or their families); (2) Technology to Support Teachers and Instructional Practice; and (3) Technology to Support Research and School Improvement. Within each section, projects are sorted into chapters based on content area, grade level, and intended outcome. In determining the chapters, the authors considered the National Education Technology Plan (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Educational Technology 2010, 2016). Because projects may have multiple foci (e.g., supporting student learning and supporting teachers), some projects were assigned to multiple sections. (See Appendix A: Compendium Process for a discussion of the process used during the compendium's development.) Each project included in this compendium is represented by a brief description that contains an overview of the major components of the project. Readers who would like more information about a project may follow the hyperlinked award number in each project description to access the Institute's online project page, which contains the full abstracts upon which the compendium's descriptions are based. The following are appended: (1) Compendium Process; (2) Web-Based Technologies by Chapter; (3) Virtual Environments / Interactive Simulations by Chapter; (4) Intelligent Tutor/Artificial Intelligence Technologies by Chapter; (5) Game-Based Technologies by Chapter; and (6) Computer-Based Assessments by Chapter."
;"Ed, Yeping Li; Ed, Zheng Zeng; Ed, Naiqing Song";2024;;Book;Eric;;Yes;;;;This Book provides an international platform for educators from different STEM disciplines to present, discuss, connect, and develop collaborations in two inter-related ways: (1) sharing and discussing changes and innovations in individual discipline-based education in STEM/STEAM, and (2) sharing and discussing the development of interdisciplinary STEM/STEAM education. Possible relationships and connections between individual disciplines (like mathematics or physics) and STEM education remain under explored and the integration of traditionally individual discipline-based education in STEM education is far from balanced. Efforts to pursue possible connections among traditionally separated individual disciplines in STEM are not only necessary for the importance of deepening and expanding interdisciplinary research and education in STEM, but also for the ever-increasing need of reflecting on and changing how traditional school subjects (like mathematics or physics) can and should be viewed, taught, and learned. Scholars from eight countries/regions provide diverse perspectives and approaches on changes and innovations in STEM disciplinary and interdisciplinary education. Disciplinary and Interdisciplinary Education in STEM will be a great resource to students and researchers in STEM education as well as STEM curriculum developers and teacher educators internationally.
Transdisciplinary Approach of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education;"Flogie, Andrej; Aberšek, Boris";2015;Journal of Baltic Science Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;At the end of 20th century and especially in this century the education field is undergoing a significant change not only as a result of technological innovations but also pedagogical innovations on the bases of artificial intelligence (AI), cognitive science and neuroscience. What interested us was the attitude of students and teachers towards these changes. In the research the participating students were arranged in two groups, the control group (CG), where conventional lessons were carried out and the experimental group (EG), in which teachers used a transdisciplinary cognitive neuroeducation model. The performance data for the both groups was acquired via questionnaire adopted from TIMSS research. The teachers' attitude towards these changes was mostly monitored via qualitative research. As is apparent from the results, a positive shift can be seen in the students' attitude towards school. And this positive attitude towards school can create in students the suitable motivation, which is the first and most important step towards quality knowledge. A positive shift was also made in the minds of the teachers.
Innovation in the Teaching-Learning Process of Global Climate Change through the Collaborative Wall;"Salas-Rueda, Ricardo-Adán; De-La-Cruz-Martínez, Gustavo; Alvarado-Zamorano, Clara; Prieto-Larios, Estefanía";2021;LUMAT: International Journal on Math, Science and Technology Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The aim of this mixed research is to analyze the students' perception about the use of the collaborative wall in the educational process of global climate change considering data science. The collaborative wall is a web application that allows the active participation of students and discussion of ideas in the classroom. During the face-to-face sessions, the students use mobile devices to share the information and images of the courses through the collaborative wall. The sample is made up of 74 students from the National Preparatory School No. 7 ""Ezequiel A. Chávez"" who took the Biology IV course during the 2019 school year. The results of machine learning (linear regression) indicate that the organization of ideas and dissemination of information in the collaborative wall positively influence the learning process of global climate change, motivation and interest of the students. Data science identifies 6 predictive models about the use of the collaborative wall in the field of Biology through the decision tree technique. In fact, the use of the collaborative wall in the Biology IV course facilitated the assimilation of knowledge about the global climate change and improved the active participation of the students in the classroom. Finally, the collaborative wall allows the creation of new educational spaces where students acquire the main role during the learning process."
Comprehensive Scientific Creativity Assessment (C-SCA): A New Approach for Measuring Scientific Creativity in Secondary School Students;"Xu, Shiyu; Reiss, Michael J.; Lodge, Wilton";2025;International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study introduces a Comprehensive Scientific Creativity Assessment (C-SCA) instrument and empirically tests its reliability and validity. While existing instruments to measure scientific creativity generally focus on a single dimension, such as divergent thinking, the C-SCA incorporates scientific knowledge, motivation in scientific creativity and thinking styles within its assessment framework. In this study, the three dimensions of C-SCA were measured using modifications of existing instruments. We provide two versions of the test, to allow tests of the effectiveness of educational interventions on scientific creativity. We incorporated ChatGPT into the scientific creativity scoring process to enhance the objectivity of the scores. Looking ahead, technological advancements hold promise for further improvements in scientific creativity assessment.
TIMSS 2023 Assessment Frameworks;"Mullis, Ina V. S.; Martin, Michael O.; von Davier, Matthias";2021;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) is a long-standing international assessment of mathematics and science at the fourth and eighth grades that has been collecting trend data every four years since 1995. About 70 countries use TIMSS trend data for monitoring the effectiveness of their education systems in a global context, and more countries join TIMSS with each subsequent assessment cycle. Because it marks the successful transition to its first fully digital assessment cycle, TIMSS 2023 is a watershed cycle in the 28 year history of TIMSS. Half the TIMSS countries pioneered the transition to digital assessment in TIMSS 2019 paving the way for an ""all digital"" turning point in TIMSS 2023. Capitalizing on the benefits of technological advances is necessary for TIMSS to remain in sync with global realities, and TIMSS 2023 will set the wheels in motion to improve the quality of TIMSS data, increase efficiency in data collection, and make the data more useful. To provide deeper insights into how students approach mathematics and science assessment tasks, solve problems, and communicate their responses, TIMSS 2023 will include more complex and innovative item types that capture both responses and process indicators. A digital item designer and translation system will support TIMSS 2023 item development, enabling interactive opportunities and provision of various digital tools for students to use in developing and providing their responses. The idea of Problem Solving and Inquiry (PSI) Tasks introduced in TIMSS 2019 (ED596167) will be further developed. PSI tasks are based on attractive, interactive scenarios that allow students to follow a series of steps toward a solution or goal. A variety of PSI tasks will be integrated into the mathematics and science assessments. Finally, a concerted effort will be made to increase the degree of automated scoring to improve scoring accuracy and comparability across countries, including research into using machine learning to evaluate graphical and short written responses."
Removing Remediation Requirements: Effectiveness of Intervention Programs;"Fine, Anne; Duggan, Mickle; Braddy, Linda";2009;PRIMUS;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Remediation of incoming college freshman students is a national concern because remediated students are at higher risk of failing to complete their degrees. Some Oklahoma higher education institutions are working to assist K-12 systems in finding ways to reduce the number of incoming college freshman students requiring remediation. This study investigated one such undertaking in which 12th-grade students took mathematics courses modeled after the East Central University ATLAS developmental mathematics program in an effort to enhance their performance on college admissions and placement assessments. A key feature of ATLAS is its use of an artificial intelligence-based learning system called ALEKS to hone mathematical skills. This study compared the efficacy of ATLAS-patterned high school mathematics courses with non-ALEKS-based mathematics courses or no mathematics course in removing remediation requirements for college-bound high school seniors. Results support the effectiveness of taking a senior-year high school mathematics course in reducing the number of college-bound high school seniors requiring mathematics remediation and also suggest that the ATLAS program may provide an alternative for some students to remove their college mathematics remediation requirements while still in high school.

The Racializing Forces of/in AI Educational Technologies;"Dixon-Román, Ezekiel; Nichols, T. Philip; Nyame-Mensah, Ama";2020;Learning, Media and Technology;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"In this article, we examine the sociopolitical implications of AI technologies as they are integrated into writing instruction and assessment. Drawing from new materialist and Black feminist thought, we consider how learning analytics platforms for writing are animated by and through entanglements of algorithmic reasoning, state standards and assessments, embodied literacy practices, and sociopolitical relations. We do a close reading of research and development documents associated with ""Essay Helper,"" a machine learning platform that provides formative feedback on student writing based on standards-aligned rubrics and training data. In particular, we consider the performative acts of the algorithm in the ""Essay Helper"" platform -- both in the ways that reconstitutes material-discursive relations of difference, and its implications for transactions of teaching and learning. We argue that, through these processes, the algorithms function as racializing assemblages, and conclude by suggesting pathways toward alternative futures that reconfigure the sociopolitical relations the platform inherits."
"An Interview Reflection on ""Intelligent Tutoring Goes to School in the Big City""";"Koedinger, Kenneth R.; Aleven, Vincent";2016;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Our 1997 article in ""IJAIED"" Reported on a study that showed that a new algebra curriculum with an embedded intelligent tutoring system (the Algebra Cognitive Tutor) dramatically enhanced high-school students' learning. The main motivation for the study was to demonstrate that intelligent tutors that have cognitive science research embedded in them could have real impact in schools. This study was one of the first large-scale classroom evaluations of the integrated use of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) in high schools. A core challenge was figuring out how to embed this new technology into a curriculum and into the existing social context of schools. A key element of the study design was to include multiple kinds of assessments, including standardized test items and items measuring complex problem solving and use of representations. The results were powerful: ""On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on standardized tests and 100% on tests targeting the [course] objectives."" We suggested that the study was evidence ""that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and unforgiving settings like urban high schools."" Since this study, many more classroom studies comparing instruction that includes an ITS against business as usual have been conducted, often showing advantages for the ITS-enhanced curricula. More rigorous randomized field trials are now more commonplace, but the approach of using multiple assessments in large-scale randomized field trials has not caught on. Cognitive task analysis will remain fundamental to the success of ITSs. A key remaining question for ITS is to find out how they can be used most effectively to support open-ended problem solving, either online or offline. Given all the recent excitement around Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is interesting to note that our field of Artificial Intelligence in Education has been making huge, less recognized, progress with impact on millions of students and with the majority of those students finishing the course!"
Say What? Automatic Modeling of Collaborative Problem Solving Skills from Student Speech in the Wild;"Pugh, Samuel L.; Subburaj, Shree Krishna; Rao, Arjun Ramesh; Stewart, Angela E. B.; Andrews-Todd, Jessica; D'Mello, Sidney K.";2021;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;We investigated the feasibility of using automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to classify collaborative problem solving (CPS) skills from recorded speech in noisy environments. We analyzed data from 44 dyads of middle and high school students who used videoconferencing to collaboratively solve physics and math problems (35 and 9 dyads in school and lab environments, respectively). Trained coders identified seven cognitive and social CPS skills (e.g., sharing information) in 8,660 utterances. We used a state-of-the-art deep transfer learning approach for NLP, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), with a special input representation enabling the model to analyze adjacent utterances for contextual cues. We achieved a micro-average AUROC score (across seven CPS skills) of 0.80 using ASR transcripts, compared to 0.91 for human transcripts, indicating a decrease in performance attributable to ASR error. We found that the noisy school setting introduced additional ASR error, which reduced model performance (micro-average AUROC of 0.78) compared to the lab (AUROC = 0.83). We discuss implications for real-time CPS assessment and support in schools. [For the full proceedings, see ED615472.]
;Khine, Myint Swe;2020;;Book;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Assessment and evaluation have always been an integral part of educational process. Quality and purposeful assessment can assist in students' learning and their achievement. While there has been a rapid growth in international, standardized student assessments in the past few decades, a large number of education systems participating in these assessments are now focusing their attention on developing new national, within-country assessments to evaluate educational standards and to modify the curriculum to better suit to the demands of the 21st century. Education systems that are successful in linking the national curriculum and assessments directly to international standards are performing better on international standardized assessments of reading, mathematics, and science. This Book covers studies related to educational assessment in addressing quality of education and performance improvement. The Book presents the distinguished and exemplary works by educators and researchers in the field highlighting the contemporary trends and issues, creative and unique approaches, innovative methods, frameworks, pedagogies and theoretical and practical aspects in assessment processes in various educational settings. This Book contains the following chapters: (1) Treasures in Trends: Analyses of TIMSS and PIRLS Trends Using Contextual Data (Martin Hooper, Yifan Bai, and Markus Broer); (2) Program for International Student Assessment: Constancy, Evolution, and Innovation (Miyako Ikeda); (3) Development of a Measurement Approach to Assess 21st Century Skills (Claire Scoular and Michael Timms); (4) Advances in Measuring ""Hard-to-Measure"" Skills (Patrick C.

Meta-Affective Behaviour within an Intelligent Tutoring System for Mathematics;"Rebolledo-Mendez, Genaro; Huerta-Pacheco, N. Sofia; Baker, Ryan S.; du Boulay, Benedict";2022;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-021-00247-1;Yes;;;;Many previous studies have highlighted the influence of learners' affective states on learning with tutoring systems. However, the associations between learning and learners' meta-affective capability are still unclear. The goal of this paper is to analyse meta-affective capability and its influence on learning outcomes as well as the dynamics of affect over time. Two criteria, awareness and self-regulation, were employed to define meta-affective capability. An exploratory study (n = 54) was conducted in which students at the secondary level were asked to interact with an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics and to self-Report their affect during their interactions with the system. Pre-post learning outcomes were also measured. A post-hoc comparison of learning gains was made between more meta-affectively capable and less meta-affectively capable students. The results provide some empirical evidence to support the hypoThesis that having meta-affective capability is positively associated with learning. Students not demonstrating meta-affective capability seemed to transition frequently from boredom to frustration (p = 0.0284) and from concentration to neutral (p = 0.0017). However, only a small percentage of the sample were classified as having meta-affective capability, indicating that it is important to scaffold students who are not meta-affectively capable.
Visualizing the Commognitive Processes in Computer-Supported One-to-One Tutoring;"Lu, Jijian; Zhang, Xiaojie; Stephens, Max";2019;Interactive Learning Environments;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study aims to visualize the commognitive processes in computer-supported one-to-one teaching and learning. By commognitive processes we mean cognitive processes and interpersonal communication. A 6-years mathematics teacher and a 15-year-old boy in China, who have done computer-supported one-to-one tutoring, were chosen to be the samples. We collected four computer-supported one-to-one tutoring videos (60-90 min) about one chapter of mathematical set knowledge between one teacher and one student, and 30 min interview video from the teacher. Based on Bloom's cognitive classification theory and commognition theory, we develop a commognitive classification framework, then encode and visualize the videos. We found that mathematics commognition processes can be divided into six levels and classified into three types: teacher-lead, student-lead, and teacher-student comparison.
Learning Designs That Empower: Navigating Sandbox Data Science at the Intersection of Computing, Big Data and Social Media;"Barany, Amanda; Scarola, Andi Danielle; Acquah, Alex; Reza, Sayed Mohsin; Johnson, Michael A.; Walker, Justice";2024;Information and Learning Sciences;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Purpose: There is a need for precollege learning designs that empower youth to be epistemic agents in contexts that intersect burgeoning areas of computing, big data and social media. The purpose of this study is to explore how ""sandbox"" or open-inquiry data science with social media supports learning. Design/methodology/approach: This paper offers vignettes from an illustrative youth study case that highlights the pedagogical prospects and obstacles tied to designing for open-ended inquiry with computational data science to access or ""scrape"" Twitter/X. The youth case showcases how social media can be taken up productively and in ways that facilitate epistemological agency, an approach where individuals actively shape understanding and knowledge-creation processes, highlighting the potentially transformative impact this approach might have in empowering learners to engage productively. Findings: The authors identify three key affordances for learning that emerged from the illustrative case: (1) flexible opportunities for content-specific domain mastery, (2) situated inquiry that embodies next-generation science practices and (3) embedded computational skill development. The authors discuss these findings in relation to contemporary education needs to broaden participation in data science and computing. Originality/value: To address challenges in current data science education associated with supporting sustained and productive engagement in computing-based data science, the authors leverage a ""sandbox"" approach -- an original pedagogical framework to support open inquiry with precollege groups. The authors demonstrate how ""big data"" drawn from social media with high school-aged youth supports learning designs and outcomes by emphasizing learner interests and authentic practice."

The ASSISTments Ecosystem: Building a Platform That Brings Scientists and Teachers Together for Minimally Invasive Research on Human Learning and Teaching;"Heffernan, Neil T.; Heffernan, Cristina Lindquist";2014;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The ASSISTments project is an ecosystem of a few hundred teachers, a platform, and researchers working together. Development professionals help train teachers and get teachers to participate in studies. The platform and these teachers help researchers (sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly) simply by using content the teacher selects. The platform, hosted by Worcester Polytechnic Institute, allows teachers to write individual ASSISTments (composed of questions with answers and associated hints, solutions, web-based videos, etc.) or to use pre-built ASSISTments, bundle them together in a problem set, and assign these to students. The system gives immediate feedback to students while they are working and provides student-level data to teachers on any assignment. The word ""ASSISTments"" blends tutoring ""assistance"" with ""assessment"" Reporting to teachers and students. While originally focused on mathematics, the platform now has content from many other subjects (e.g., science, English, Statistics, etc.). Due to the large library of mathematics content, however, it is mostly used by math teachers. Over 50,000 students used ASSISTments last school year (2013-4) and this number has been doubling each year for the last 8 years. The platform allows any user, mostly researchers, to create randomized controlled trials in the content, which has helped us use the tool in over 18 published and an equal number of unpublished studies. The data collected by the system has also been used in a few dozen peer-reviewed data mining publications. This paper will not seek to review these publications, but instead we will share why ASSISTments has been successful and what lessons were learned along the way. The first lesson learned was to build a platform for learning sciences, not a product that focused on a math topic. That is, ASSISTments is a tool, not a curriculum. A second lesson learned is expressed by the mantra ""Put the teacher in charge, not the computer."" This second lesson is about building a flexible system that allows teachers to use the tool in concert with the classroom routine. Once teachers are using the tool they are more likely to want to participate in research studies. These lessons were born from the design decisions about what the platform supports and does not support. In conclusion, goals for the future will be presented."
A Step-Based Tutoring System to Teach Underachieving Students How to Construct Algebraic Models;"VanLehn, Kurt; Milner, Fabio; Banerjee, Chandrani; Wetzel, Jon";2024;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;An algebraic model uses a set of algebraic equations to describe a situation. Constructing such models is a fundamental skill, but many students still lack the skill, even after taking several algebra courses in high school and college. For such students, we developed instruction that taught students to decompose the to-be-modelled situation into schema applications, where a schema represents a simple relationship such as distance-rate-time or part-whole. However, when a model consists of multiple schema applications, it needs some connection among them, usually represented by letting the same variable appear in the slots of two or more schemas. Students in our studies seemed to have more trouble identifying connections among schema applications than identifying the schema applications themselves. We developed several tutoring systems and evaluated them in university classes. One of them, a step-based tutoring system called OMRaaT (One Mathematical Relationship at a Time), was both reliably superior (p = 0.02, d = 0.67) to baseline and markedly superior (p < 0.001, d = 0.84) to an answer-based tutoring system using only commercially available software (MATLAB Grader).
;Meletiadou, Eleni;2023;;Book;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Recent evolutions, such as pervasive networking and other enabling technologies, have been increasingly changing human life, knowledge acquisition, and the way works are performed and students learn.

They have therefore embraced digitally enhanced learning to provide increased flexibility and access for their students. The ""HandBook of Research on Redesigning Teaching, Learning, and Assessment in the Digital Era"" provides insights into the transformation of education in the digital era and responds to the needs of learners of any context and background through relevant studies that include sound pedagogical and content knowledge. Covering key topics such as hybrid learning, media, remote learning, and social media, this major reference work is ideal for administrators, policymakers, academicians, researchers, scholars, practitioners, librarians, instructors, and students."
A Multimedia Adaptive Tutoring System for Mathematics That Addresses Cognition, Metacognition and Affect;"Arroyo, Ivon; Woolf, Beverly Park; Burelson, Winslow; Muldner, Kasia; Rai, Dovan; Tai, Minghui";2014;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This article describes research results based on multiple years of experimentation and real-world experience with an adaptive tutoring system named Wayang Outpost. The system represents a novel adaptive learning technology that has shown successful outcomes with thousands of students, and provided teachers with valuable information about students' mathematics performance. We define progress in three areas: improved student ""cognition,"" ""engagement,"" and ""affect,"" and we attribute this improvement to specific components and interventions that are inherently ""affective,"" ""cognitive,"" and ""metacognitive"" in nature. For instance, improved student ""cognitive outcomes"" have been measured with pre-post tests and state standardized tests, and achieved due to personalization of content and math fluency training. Improved student ""engagement"" was achieved by supporting students' metacognition and motivation via affective learning companions and progress Reports, measured via records of student gaming of the system. Student ""affect"" within the tutor was measured through sensors and student self-Reports, and supported through affective learning companions and progress Reports. Collectively, these studies elucidate a suite of effective strategies to support advanced personalized learning via an intelligent adaptive tutor that can be tailored to the individual needs, emotions, cognitive states, and metacognitive skills of learners."
Transformative Connections: Community-Based K-12 Computing Program Strives to Strengthen Academic and Career Aspirations of Its Participants;Roach, Ronald;2005;Black Issues in Higher Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The Joint Educational Facilities Inc. (JEF) computer science program has as its goal to acquaint minority and socially disadvantaged K-12 students with computer science basics and the innovative subdisciplines within the field, and to reinforce the college ambitions of participants or help them consider college as an option. A non-profit community-based K-12 organization based in Washington, DC, JEF familiarizes students with advanced computer science topics, including artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing applications. An estimated 400 students from poor to middle-class households have been a part of the program, which aims to increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented minorities successfully entering math, science and engineering baccalaureate programs. In addition, JEF presents a compelling argument for the concept of supplementary education, the structured educational activities that occur outside formal schooling, and has gained attention from those interested in solutions aimed at closing the academic achievement gap between White/Asian and Black/Latino students. Many JEF students have earned college degrees in science and technology fields; former participants have also earned masters' degrees and at least one student has a Ph.D. in computer architecture. The volunteer leadership strongly believes that community-based learning projects can help significantly boost the participation rate of underrepresented minorities in math and science fields. JEF's partnership with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), based in Illinois, is described."

Proceedings of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) (16th, Bengaluru, India, July 11-14, 2023);"Feng, Mingyu; Käser, Tanja; Talukdar, Partha";2023;International Educational Data Mining Society;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The Indian Institute of Science is proud to host the fully in-person sixteenth iteration of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) during July 11-14, 2023. EDM is the annual flagship conference of the International Educational Data Mining Society. The theme of this year's conference is ""Educational data mining for amplifying human potential."" Not all students or seekers of knowledge receive the education necessary to help them realize their full potential, be it due to a lack of resources or lack of access to high quality teaching. The dearth in high-quality educational content, teaching aids, and methodologies, and non-availability of objective feedback on how they could become better teachers, deprive our teachers from achieving their full potential. The administrators and policy makers lack tools for making optimal decisions such as optimal class sizes, class composition, and course sequencing. All these handicap the nations, particularly the economically emergent ones, who recognize the centrality of education for their growth. EDM-2023 has striven to focus on concepts, principles, and techniques mined from educational data for amplifying the potential of all the stakeholders in the education system. The spotlights of EDM-2023 include: (1) Five keynote talks by outstanding researchers of eminence; (2) A plenary Test of Time award talk and a Banquet talk; (3) Five tutorials (foundational as well as advanced); (4) Four thought provoking panels on contemporary themes; (5) Peer reviewed technical paper and poster presentations; (6) Doctoral students consortium; and (7) An enchanting cultural programme.

A Decision Support System for Predicting Students' Performance;"Livieris, Ioannis E.; Mikropoulos, Tassos A.; Pintelas, Panagiotis";2016;Themes in Science and Technology Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Educational data mining is an emerging research field concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational context. These data allow the educational stakeholders to discover new, interesting and valuable knowledge about students. In this paper, we present a new user-friendly decision support tool for predicting students' performance concerning the final examinations of a school year. Our proposed tool is based on a hybrid predicting system incorporating a number of possible machine learning methods and achieves better performance than any examined single learning algorithm. Furthermore, significant advantages of the presented tool are that it has a simple interface and it can be deployed in any platform under any operating system. Our objective is that this work may be used to support student admission procedures and strengthen the service system in educational institutions.
Carelessness and Affect in an Intelligent Tutoring System for Mathematics;"San Pedro, Maria Ofelia Z.; de Baker, Ryan S. J.; Rodrigo, Ma Mercedes T.";2014;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;We investigate the relationship between students' affect and their frequency of careless errors while using an Intelligent Tutoring System for middle school mathematics. A student is said to have committed a careless error when the student's answer is wrong despite knowing the skill required to provide the correct answer. We operationalize the probability that an error is careless through the use of an automated detector, developed using educational data mining, which infers the probability that an error involves carelessness rather than not knowing the relevant skill. This detector is then applied to log data produced by high-school students in the Philippines using a Cognitive Tutor for scatterplots. We study the relationship between carelessness and affect, triangulating between the detector of carelessness and field observations of affect. Surprisingly, we find that carelessness is common among students who frequently experience engaged concentration. This finding implies that a highly engaged student may paradoxically become overconfident or impulsive, leading to more careless errors. In contrast, students displaying confusion or boredom make fewer careless errors. Further analysis over time suggests that confused and bored students have lower learning overall. Thus, their mistakes appear to stem from a genuine lack of knowledge rather than carelessness.

MAThesis: An Intelligent Web-Based Algebra Tutoring School;"Sklavakis, Dimitrios; Refanidis, Ioannis";2013;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This article describes an intelligent, integrated, web-based school for tutoring expansion and factoring of algebraic expressions. It provides full support for the management of the usual teaching tasks in a traditional school: Student and teacher registration, creation and management of classes and test papers, individualized assignment of exercises, intelligent step by step guidance in solving exercises, student interaction recording, skill mastery statistics and student assessment. The intelligence of the system lies in its Algebra Tutor, a model-tracing tutor developed within the MAThesis project, that teaches a breadth of 16 top-level math skills (algebraic operations): monomial multiplication, division and power, monomial-polynomial and polynomial-polynomial multiplication, parentheses elimination, collect like terms, identities (square of sum and difference, product of sum by difference, cube of sum and difference), factoring (common factor, term grouping, identities, quadratic form). These skills are further decomposed in simpler ones giving a deep domain expertise model of 104 primitive skills. The tutor has two novel features: a) it exhibits ""intelligent task recognition"" by identifying all skills present in any expression through intelligent parsing, and b) for each identified skill, the tutor traces all the sub-skills, a feature we call ""deep model tracing."" Furthermore, based on these features, the tutor achieves ""broad knowledge monitoring"" by recording student performance for all skills present in any expression. Forty teachers who evaluated the system in a 3-hours workshop appreciated the fine-grained step-by-step guidance of the student, the equally fine grained student model created by the tutor and its ability to tutor any exercise that contains the aforementioned math skills. The system was also used in a real junior high school classroom with 20 students for three months. Evaluation of the students' performance in the domain of factoring gave positive learning results."
The Principles of Designing an Expert System in Teaching Mathematics;"Salekhova, Lailya; Nurgaliev, Albert; Zaripova, Rinata; Khakimullina, Nailya";2013;Universal Journal of Educational Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study reveals general didactic concepts of the Expert Systems (ES) development process in the educational area. The proof of concept is based on the example of teaching the 8th grade Algebra subject. The main contribution in this work is the implementation of innovative approaches in analysis and processing of data by expert system as well as the development of the step-by-step algorithm to build a table of dependencies between subjects in a course, known as Concept-Effect Relationship (CER) model, which is introduced in this research work. The CER model is the core component of the ES, based on which the system builds the individual educational strategy for a pupil. The problem of building a table of dependencies between subjects in a course has been a significant obstacle when using this approach in real life due to its time complexity and a demand for significant efforts from multiple experts. Our novel approach introduces a general algorithm for building a dependency table with no linking to a specific subject, thus making CER model implementation easier in real-life educational practice.

The development of expert systems in general is reviewed as are its applications in education as intelligent tutoring systems and in special education in the areas of student classification, teacher education, math teaching consultancy, and language teaching consultancy. The literature on the role of artificial intelligence is then reviewed noting concerns with increasing reliance on technology, the increasing tendency toward technological elitism, possible reductions in human creativity, and the need for man to control technology and not be controlled by it. While noting the contributions of computer managed learning to special education in  individualizing learning and recordkeeping, the paper raises questions concerning effects of future more extensive use of artificial intelligence in the teaching and learning process.

Results from Action Analysis in an Interactive Learning Environment;"Scheuer, Oliver; Muhlenbrock, Martin; Melis, Erica";2007;Journal of Interactive Learning Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Recently, there is a growing interest in the automatic analysis of learner activity in web-based learning environments. The approach and system SIAM (System for Interaction Analysis by Machine learning) presented in this article aims at helping to establish a basis for the automatic analysis of interaction data by developing a data logging and analysis system based on a standard database server and standard machine learning techniques. The contribution is the integration of components which are appropriate for large amount of data. The analysis system has been connected to the web-based interactive learning environment for mathematics, ActiveMath, but is designed to allow for interfacing to other web-based learning environments, too. The results of several usages of this action analysis tool are presented and discussed. They indicate potentials for further development and usages. (Contains 3 tables and 5 figures.)

SynThesis with Hypergraphs;Alvin, Christopher Thomas;2015;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;Many problems related to synThesis with intelligent tutoring may be phrased as program synThesis problems using AI-style search and formal reasoning techniques. The _x000C_first two results in this dissertation focus on problem synThesis as an aspect of intelligent tutoring systems applied to STEM-based education frameworks, specifically high school geometry. Given a geometric _x000C_figure as input, our technique constructs a hypergraph representing logical deduction of facts, and then traverses the hypergraph to synthesize problems and their corresponding solutions.Using similar techniques, our third result is focused on exhaustive synThesis of molecules. This synThesis process involves bonding sets of basic, molecular `fragments' according to chemical constraints to create molecules of increasing size. For each input set of fragments, synThesis results in a significant set of molecules. Due to big data constraints we give special consideration in how to construct a corresponding molecular hypergraph based on a target, template molecule. SynThesis of the target molecule in a laboratory environment then corresponds to any path in the molecular hypergraph from the set of fragments to the target molecule.

Automatic Classification of Semantic Content of Classroom Dialogue;"Song, Yu; Lei, Shunwei; Hao, Tianyong; Lan, Zixin; Ding, Ying";2021;Journal of Educational Computing Research;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Due to benefits for teaching and learning, an increasing number of studies have focused on classroom dialogue and how to make it productive. Coding, in which the transcribed conversation is allocated to a set of features, is commonly employed to deal with the textual data arising from this dialogue. This is generally done manually and cannot provide timely feedback to the participants. To address this issue, we explored the possibility of automatically classifying the semantic content of classroom dialogue. Seven categories (prior-known knowledge, analysis, coordination, speculation, uptake, agreement and querying) were distinguished automatically using an artificial neural network-based model. The model achieved acceptable performance and was comparable to human coding. Information about quality of dialogue can be identified in a timely manner. With this knowledge, classroom dialogue can be managed more skilfully, and a more productive form of dialogue is likely to be achieved by teachers and students.

Learning Mathematics: The Cognitive Science Approach to Mathematics Education.;Davis, Robert B.;1984;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;"There has long been dispute in mathematics between the drill and practice orientation that focuses primarily on memorizing mathematics as meaningless rote algorithms and the approach based on understanding and making creative use of mathematics. This 25-chapter Book, based on a 7-year study at the University of Illinois, seeks to explain and diffuse this controversy by taking a broad view of the cognitive science approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics. This explanation of the processes of mathematical calculation owes much to the new approach to the study of knowledge, which has been developed from Jean Piaget's observation of child behavior and the broad range of new research into artificial intelligence. It is essentially concerned with providing a deeper  understanding of the thought processes that are involved in mathematical thinking; what goes on inside children's heads as they learn mathematics and do mathematical problem-solving. Among the areas considered are: the cognitive science approach to mathematics education; deficiency in typical school curricula; the nature of representations; the ""paradigm"" teaching strategy; recognition problems; retrieval, construction, and mapping; and basic concepts used to facilitate the discussion of human information processing as it related to solving mathematical problems.

Proceedings of the International Conference on the Learning Sciences (5th, Evanston, Illinois, August 1991).;Birnbaum, Lawrence;1991;;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This volume contains the papers presented at the fifth International Conference on the Learning Sciences (formerly the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education). As the change in name signifies, a strong effort has been made to open the conference to a broader audience, including educational and cognitive psychologists interested in the problems of teaching and learning, and software designers interested in building systems to facilitate teaching and learning. The issues involved in artificial intelligence (AI) and education are of interest to a broad spectrum of researchers in education, psychology, and software systems. As in previous years, there are papers on tools and authoring systems, teaching architectures, student modelling, interfaces,  simulation, and empirical evaluation. Science education, especially biology, mathematics, and physics, receives attention, as do language and writing skills. Problems of corporate and industrial training are also addressed. Cooperative and collaborative learning involving groups of students is an important theme of many papers. Questioning and story-telling are taken as central to teaching and learning, as are the promotion of development and use of cognitive strategies. A number of papers address the question of how computer systems can aid teachers in such tasks as lesson planning. Finally, interactive video and hypermedia systems continue to grow in importance. Each of the 61 papers includes its own abstract and references; only the abstract is provided for six of the invited keynote  papers. (DB)"
Technology Outlook for STEM+ Education 2013-2018: An NMC Horizon Project Sector Analysis;"Johnson, L.; Adams Becker, S.; Estrada, V.; Martín, S.";2013;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The ""Technology Outlook for STEM+ Education 2013-2018: An NMC Horizon Project Sector Analysis"" reflects a collaborative research effort between the New Media Consortium (NMC), the Centro Superior para la Enseñanza Virtual (CSEV), the Departamento de Ingeniería Eléctrica, Electrónica y de Control at the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Education Society (IEEE) to inform education leaders about significant developments in technologies supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. The addition of the ""+"" in the acronym incorporates the applications of communication and digital media technologies into the traditional four areas of study. All of the research underpinning the Report makes use of the NMC's Delphi-based process for bringing groups of experts to a consensus viewpoint, in this case around the impact of emerging technologies on STEM+ education over the next five years. The same process underlies the NMC Horizon Report series, the most visible product of an ongoing research effort begun in 2002 to systematically identify and describe emerging technologies likely to have a large impact on education around the globe. The ""Technology Outlook for STEM+ Education 2013-2018"" was produced to explore emerging technologies and forecast their potential impact expressly in a STEM+ context. In the effort that ran from August through September 2013, the carefully selected group of 39 experts who contributed to this Report considered hundreds of relevant articles, news, blog posts, research, and project examples as part of the preparation that ultimately pinpointed the most notable emerging technology topics, trends, and challenges for STEM+ education over the next five years. The Report presents 12 ""technologies to watch,"" profiled, each on a single page that describes and defines a technology ranked as very important for STEM+ education over the next year, two to three years, and four to five years. Each page opens with a carefully crafted definition of the highlighted technology, outlines its educational relevance, points to several real life examples of its current use, and ends with a short list of additional readings for those who wish to learn more. The key sections of this Report, in general, constitute a reference and straightforward technology-planning guide for educators, researchers, administrators, policymakers, and technologists. It is our hope that this research will help to inform the choices that institutions are making about technology to improve, support, or extend teaching, learning, and research across STEM+ education.

Fair-Capacitated Clustering;"Quy, Tai Le; Roy, Arjun; Friege, Gunnar; Ntoutsi, Eirini";2021;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Traditionally, clustering algorithms focus on partitioning the data into groups of similar instances. The similarity objective, however, is not sufficient in applications where a ""fair-representation"" of the groups in terms of protected attributes like gender or race, is required for each cluster. Moreover, in many applications, to make the clusters useful for the end-user, a ""balanced cardinality"" among the clusters is required. Our motivation comes from the education domain where studies indicate that students might learn better in diverse student groups and of course groups of similar cardinality are more practical e.g., for group assignments. To this end, we introduce the ""fair-capacitated clustering problem"" that partitions the data into clusters of similar instances while ensuring cluster fairness and balancing cluster cardinalities. We propose a two-step solution to the problem: (1) we rely on fairlets to generate minimal sets that satisfy the fair constraint; and (2) we propose two approaches, namely hierarchical clustering and partitioning-based clustering, to obtain the fair-capacitated clustering. Our experiments on three educational datasets show that our approaches deliver well-balanced clusters in terms of both fairness and cardinality while maintaining a good clustering quality.

Adaptive Intelligent Support to Improve Peer Tutoring in Algebra;"Walker, Erin; Rummel, Nikol; Koedinger, Kenneth R.";2014;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves collaborative learning environments that adapt their characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant support and was more effective at improving student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of the support.

Technology and Education: Friends or Foes?;Pelton, Joseph N.;1990;;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The population explosion and developments in information technology have created a powerful need for technological advancement on a global scale. Such advancement must come through education, and such education, given the size and breadth of the need, is best realized through multimedia instruction and distance education. Communications satellites, computer-assisted instruction, and educational television programs are just a few of the new technologies already being used today for educational development in developing nations. International programming of high quality is used in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and engineering. Computer networks and new fiber optic transmission technology--along with interactive video, artificial intelligence, and other interactive  technologies--are emerging in new and creative educational applications. Technology alone, however, will not achieve the goal of technological advancement. Attention must also be paid to curriculum development, local educational environments, technology management, and international cooperation. (DB)
Women and Artificial Intelligence. Report of an Open Day for Fifth And Lower Sixth Form Girls.;"O'Malley, Claire E.; Taylor, Josie";1986;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;This paper describes an open day held for fifth and lower sixth form girls which was designed to encourage them to consider pursuit of either a degree level program or coursework in artificial intelligence at the University of Sussex. It is noted that, although the students who attended the program were enthusiastic, the number of applicants was lower than had been expected. It is suggested that the low attendance was due in part to lack of encouragement by teachers. It is also suggested that the program ought to be longer in duration in order to provide more opportunities for hands-on experience. Finally, concern is expressed that the only female students who were interested in the program seemed to be students already considering study in science, technology, or mathematics,  despite the fact that the Sussex program is interdisciplinary in nature and might be of interest to students still undecided about their career paths.

"Towards Eliminating ""Black Boxes""; A New Look at Good vs. Poor Mathematics Students.";"Davis, Robert B.; McKnight, Curtis C.";1979;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study, based on the analysis of extensive interview data using concepts and models drawn from cognitive studies of human behavior and from artificial intelligence studies of computer information processing, highlights several information-processing differences between strong and weak students. Data were collected from 300 students in grades 3 through 10 (but mainly in grades 7, 8, and 9) and a small number of adult students in a local community college. The clinical interview technique was used, during which subjects attempted to solve problems in arithmetic, algebra and geometry. Extensive analysis of these observational data were used to identify patterns of information-processing acts providing useful explanations of the differences between good and poor mathematics  students.

Computing the Average Square: An Agent-Based Introduction to Aspects of Current Psychometric Practice;"Stroup, Walter M.; Hills, Thomas; Carmona, Guadalupe";2011;Technology, Knowledge and Learning;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This paper summarizes an approach to helping future educators to engage with key issues related to the application of measurement-related statistics to learning and teaching, especially in the contexts of science, mathematics, technology and engineering (STEM) education. The approach we outline has two major elements. First, students are asked to compute an ""average square."" Second, students work with an agent-based simulation that helps them to understand how aspects of the central limit theorem might be integrated into a much larger conversation about the appropriateness, or validity, of current psychometric practices. We are particularly interested in how such practices and interpretive frameworks inform the construction of high-stakes tests. In nearly all current high-stakes test development, tests are thought of as being built-up from individual items, each of which has known statistical properties. The activity sequence outlined in this paper helps future educators to understand the implications of this practice, and the sometimes problematic assumptions it entails. This instructional sequence has been used extensively as part of a core course in a university-based certification program in the United States (UTeach) recognized for its innovative approaches to developing a new generation of secondary STEM educators."

Expert Systems in the Individual Education Program Process. Technical Paper.;"Lubke, Margaret; Others, And";1985;;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The paper describes the use of expert systems technology in translating test and observational data into objectives for Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) with handicapped students. The Math Test Interpreter (MTI) is designed to combine student information, results from the Key Math Diagnostic Arithmetic Test and additional program generated criterion referenced test data to produce a prescription in mathematics. The Behavior Consultant (BC) program applies the expert system approach to classroom behavior problems and features two videodisc components. Examples of a typical consultation with each of the expert systems illustrate their factual and heuristic rules and their use of backchaining to work from hypothesized conclusions to known facts. Possible system outcomes are  delineated, including situations of inadequate information and development of objectives for IEPs. The paper concludes with a note on the implications of appropriate, clearly stated objectives for the education of handicapped students. (CL)
Design and Implementation of an Intelligent Tutoring System in the View of Learner Autonomy;"Le, Huixiao; Jia, Jiyou";2022;Interactive Technology and Smart Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Purpose: In intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), learners were often granted limited authority and are forced to obey the decision of the system which might not satisfy their needs. Failure to grant learners sufficient autonomy could yield unexpected effects that hinder learning, including undermining learners' motivation, priming learners' aversion to the algorithm. On the contrary, granting learners overwhelming autonomy could also be harmful as the absence of learning support would also have a negative impact on learning. As such, this study aims to design and implement an intelligent tutoring system that offers learners proper autonomy. Design/methodology/approach: The main learning activity in the system is doing exercises, and by finishing exercises learners could earn virtual coins. Based on item response theory, exercises are administered to learners with proper difficulty. Based on a recommended difficulty parameter predicted by the system, learners could manually modify the difficulty of the exercises, they could earn more credits by finishing more challenging exercises. Meanwhile, a pedagogical agent is embedded. Learners could customize the agent's personality jointly with the system to create the learning context they prefer. Findings: A intelligent tutoring system with proper learner autonomy (LA) is designed and implemented. Originality/value: Few previous researches have noticed the potentially important role that LA plays in ITS. Learning might be facilitated using such a design.
Felicity Conditions for Human Skill Acquisition: Validating an AI-Based Theory. Cognitive and Instructional Sciences Series.;VanLehn, Kurt;1983;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"A theory of how people learn certain procedural skills is presented. It is based on the idea that the teaching and learning that goes on in a classroom is like an ordinary conversation. The speaker (teacher) compresses a non-linear knowledge structure (the target procedure) into a linear sequence of utterances (lessons). The listener (student) constructs a knowledge structure (the learned procedure) from the utterance sequence (lesson sequence). Speakers unknowingly obey certain constraints, called felicity conditions or conversational postulates, which help listeners construct an appropriate knowledge structure. This research has shown that there are felicity conditions on lesson sequences that help students learn procedures. Three felicity conditions were discovered, forming  the central hypotheses in the learning theory, which was embedded in a model, a large computer program using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The model's performance was compared to data from several thousand students learning to subtract multidigit numbers, add fractions, and solve simple algebraic equations. A key criterion for the theory is that the set of procedures that the model ""learns"" should exactly match the set of procedures that students actually acquire. Both testing the predictions and arguing for the validity of the theory are included in the Report. (Author/MNS)"
A Novel Video Recommendation System for Algebra: An Effectiveness Evaluation Study;"Leite, Walter L.; Roy, Samrat; Chakraborty, Nilanjana; Michailidis, George; Huggins-Manley, A. Corinne; D'Mello, Sidney K.; Faradonbeh, Mohamad Kazem Shirani; Jensen, Emily; Kuang, Huan; Jing, Zeyuan";2022;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This study presents a novel video recommendation system for an algebra virtual learning environment (VLE) that leverages ideas and methods from engagement measurement, item response theory, and reinforcement learning. Following Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) theory, but considering low affect and high affect students separately, we developed a system of five categories of video recommendations: (1) Watch new video; (2) Review current topic video with a new tutor; (3) Review segment of current video with current tutor; (4) Review segment of current video with a new tutor; and (5) Watch next video in curriculum sequence. The category of recommendation was determined by student scores on a quiz and a sensor-free engagement detection model. New video recommendations (i.e., category 1) were selected based on a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that takes input from an item response theory model. The recommendation system was evaluated in a large field experiment, both before and after school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show evidence of effectiveness of the video recommendation algorithm during the period of normal school operations, but the effect disappears after school closures. Implications for teacher orchestration of technology for normal classroom use and periods of school closure are discussed."

Using Construct Validity Techniques To Evaluate an Automated Cognitive Model of Geometric Proof Writing.;Shotsberger, Paul G.;1994;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (1991) has identified the use of computers as a necessary teaching tool for enhancing mathematical discourse in schools. One possible vehicle of technological change in mathematics classrooms is the Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), an artificially intelligent computer-based tutor. This paper Reports on 3 construct validity studies that have been conducted with 97 high school students in order to demonstrate the correspondence, or lack thereof, between the theoretical constructs of the Diagram Configuration (DC) Model of geometric proof-writing expertise (Koedinger & Anderson, 1990) and the hints and errors being recorded by an instantiation of the DC Model called ANGLE, an intelligent geometric proof tutor. Results of the studies  supported the appropriateness of construct validity techniques for analyzing ITS data. The results partially confirm a hypothesized factor structure for the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the results, including suggestions for modifications of the ANGLE program. (Contains nine references and six tables.) (Author/SLD)

There is substantial interest at present in the development and use of software agents. They are being deployed in large and increasing numbers to assist users in finding and managing information. This research focuses on how intelligent agents can help students to improve their problem solving skills. The paper first motivates the utility and need for agents for education. Using this motivation as a guide, requirements are  derived for the formation of a PIM as a cognitive tool. The paper then describes possible tasks for the Personal Intelligent Mentor and discusses how the PIM will interact with other agents, its environment, and users to improve its capabilities.

[Proceedings of the] International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) (3rd, Pittsburgh, PA, July 11-13, 2010);"Baker, Ryan S. J. d; Merceron, Agathe; Pavlik, Philip I.";2010;International Working Group on Educational Data Mining;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The Third International Conference on Data Mining (EDM 2010) was held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. It follows the second conference at the University of Cordoba, Spain, on July 1-3, 2009 and the first edition of the conference held in Montreal in 2008, and a series of workshops within the AAAI, AIED, EC-TEL, ICALT, ITS, and UM conferences. EDM 2011 will be held in Eindhoven, Netherlands. EDM brings together researchers from computer science, education, psychology, psychometrics, and statistics to analyze large data sets to answer educational research questions. The increase in instrumented educational software and databases of student test scores, has created large repositories of data reflecting how students learn.

Higher Order Rule Characterization of Heuristics for Compass and Straight Edge Constructions in Geometry.;"Scandura, Joseph M.; Others, And";1975;;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The research Reported in this paper was designed to analyze the incidence of use of higher-order rules by students solving geometric construction problems. A carefully selected set of construction problems was subjected to rigorous a priori analysis by mathematics educators to determine what basic and second-order rules might be used by able high school students in their solution. Categories of problems analyzed include: patterns of two loci, patterns of similar figures, combined two loci and similar figures, patterns of auxiliary figures, and patterns of loci, similar figures, and auxiliary figures. The analysis was successful in making more precise the heuristic approach of George Polya. Overall, the viability of this method of analysis was demonstrated. The authors cite some  limitations of the study and future directions for their work. (SD)
Prediction of Students' Science Achievement: An Application of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Regression Trees;Depren, Serpil Kilic;2018;Journal of Baltic Science Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;Turkey is ranked at the 54th out of 72 countries in terms of science achievement in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey conducted in 2015, which is a very big disappointment for that country. The aim of this research was to determine factors affecting Turkish students' science achievements in order to identify the improvement areas using PISA 2015 dataset. To achieve this aim, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) approaches were used and these approaches were compared in terms of model accuracy statistics. Since Singapore was the top performer country in terms of science achievement in PISA 2015 survey, the analysis results of Turkey and Singapore were compared to each other to understand the differences. The results showed that MARS outperforms the CART in terms of measuring the prediction of students' science achievement. Furthermore, the most important factors affecting science achievements were environmental optimism, home possessions and science learning time (minutes per week) for Turkey, while the index of economic, social and cultural status, environmental awareness and enjoyment of science for Singapore.

The Development, Testing, and Use of a Computer Interface To Evaluate an Information Processing Model Describing the Rates of Encoding and Mental Rotation in High School Students of High and Low Spatial Ability.;Donelson, Frederick Loye;1990;;Thesis;Eric;;Yes;;;;This study investigated the speed of encoding and rotation of images during simple spatial rotational operations to discover any similarities or differences in groups of differing spatial ability. This project was subdivided into five basic subproblems. First, research was done to arrive at a simple, easily testable information processing model that could describe both the encoding and rotation components of spatial thought. Second, a computer software/hardware package was developed to measure reaction times of encoding and rotational tasks using equipment that would be affordable to the average high school science teacher. Third, the instrument was field tested with high school students. Fourth, 37 students from a field of 107 biology and earth science students were identified  as being of high or low spatial ability. Finally, these students were tested with the developed instrument to investigate more fully the roles of encoding and mental rotation during spatial activity. The purpose of this project was to develop a working model of spatial thought so that it might be of use in persuading teachers to use intervention strategies on a more regular basis in the classroom. A problem section, literature review, methodology, results, conclusion, implications, and recommendations are included. Appended is a listing of the computer program used in this study. (KR)
Proceedings of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) (12th, Montreal, Canada, July 2-5, 2019);"Lynch, Collin F.; Merceron, Agathe; Desmarais, Michel; Nkambou, Roger";2019;International Educational Data Mining Society;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"The 12th iteration of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2019) is organized under the auspices of the International Educational Data Mining Society in Montreal, Canada. The theme of this year's conference is EDM in Open-Ended Domains. As EDM has matured it has increasingly been applied to open-ended and ill-defined tasks such as writing, design, and collaborative problem solving, and it has been used in new informal contexts where student actions are at best semi-structured. This iteration of the conference includes a range of work in these and other areas. This year's conference features three invited talks: Julita Vassileva, Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Saskatchewan, Canada; Steve Ritter, Co-Founder and Chief Scientist, Carnegie Learning Inc., Pittsburgh; and Michael Mozer, Professor Department of Computer Science and Institute of Cognitive Science University of Colorado. The number of accepted papers include 22 full papers and 42 short papers. An additional 47 papers were accepted to the poster track. The poster and demo track itself accepted 14 contributions out of 34 submissions. Together with the ""Journal of Educational Data Mining"" (""JEDM""), the EDM 2019 conference held a ""JEDM"" Track that provides researchers a venue to deliver more substantial mature work than is possible in a conference proceeding and to present their work to a live audience. The papers submitted to this track followed the ""JEDM"" peer review process. Two such papers are featured in the conference's program. Additionally this year, papers that were regularly published in the journal in 2018 were invited for presentation at the conference. Two authors accepted this invitation. The main conference invited contributions to an Industry Track in addition to the main track. The EDM 2019 Industry Track received eleven submissions of which six were accepted. The EDM conference continues its tradition of providing opportunities for young researchers to present their work and receive feedback from their peers and senior researchers. The doctoral consortium this year features eight such presentations. This year's conference includes also an invited talk by the authors of the 2018 winner of the EDM Test of Time Award. This year's talk is delivered by Mykola Pechenizkiy. In addition to the main program, there are three workshops: (1) Learning Analytics: Building bridges between the Education and the Computing communities; (2) Reinforcement Learning for Educational Data Mining; and (3) Workshop on EDM & Games: Leveling Up Engaged Learning with Data-Rich Analytics. Three tutorials were presented as well: (1) Sharing and Reusing Data and Analytic Methods with LearnSphere; (2) Causal Discovery with Tetrad in LearnSphere's Tigris and Designing and Developing Open; and (3) Pedagogically-Based Predictive Models using the Moodle Analytics API."
Detecting Learning Moment-by-Moment;"Baker, Ryan S. J. D.; Goldstein, Adam B.; Heffernan, Neil T.";2011;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Intelligent tutors have become increasingly accurate at detecting whether a student knows a skill, or knowledge component (KC), at a given time. However, current student models do not tell us exactly at which point a KC is learned. In this paper, we present a machine-learned model that assesses the probability that a student learned a KC at a specific problem step (instead of at the next or previous problem step). We use this model to analyze which KCs are learned gradually, and which are learned in ""eureka"" moments. We also discuss potential ways that this model could be used to improve the effectiveness of cognitive mastery learning. (Contains 5 figures and 2 tables.)"

Visual Salience of Algebraic Transformations;"Kirshner, David; Awtry, Thomas";2004;Journal for Research in Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;"Information processing researchers have assumed that algebra symbol skills depend on mastery of the abstract rules presented in the curriculum (Matz, 1980; Sleeman, 1986). Thus, students' ubiquitous algebra errors have been taken as indicating the need to embed algebra in rich contextual settings (Kaput, 1995; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics [NCTM] Algebra Working Group, 1998). This study explored a nonrepresentational account of symbolic algebra skills as feature correlation within the visual field. We present evidence that algebra students respond spontaneously to the visual patterns of the notational display apart from engagement with the declarative content of the rules. Thus, persistent algebra errors may reflect disengagement from declarative content rather than an inability to deal with it. We sketch a Lexical Support System designed to sustain students' engagement with the declarative content of algebraic rules and processes, thus complementing the exciting curricular possibilities being developed for referentially rich algebra.

Application of Technology to Cognitive Development.;Wilson, Louise;1989;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This Report presents a summary of research being conducted at the University of Minnesota in which new technologies are being applied to development of cognition in hearing impaired learners. The study involved an application of concept analysis, information-processing theories, and group-based interactive technology in the teaching of mathematical word-problem-solving. Teaching strategies were implemented by means of a group interaction technology system called ""Discourse."" Discourse allows the teacher to enter questions and answers into the system and to display them on a large video screen. While questions or problems to solve are displayed, the students enter responses into individual keypads and are given immediate feedback by means of a visual blinking light and audio""beep."" In the study, a group of hearing-impaired and severely language-delayed learning disabled students (N=25) were taught mathematical word problem-solving strategies using concept analysis and identification adapted to the Discourse system.

Mis-generalization: An Explanation of Observed Mal-rules.;Sleeman, D.;1984;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;Previous studies were conducted with 14- to 15-year-old students on the nature of the processes they used to solve tasks given the incorrect/buggy/mal-rules. The computer-based Leeds Modelling System (LMS) was implemented and a database of examples, correct and incorrect, or mal-rules had been established which was sufficient to diagnose the majority of difficulties encountered by 15-year-old students. When the same database was used with 24 14-year-old students, the outcome was very different. A high percentage of the student errors were not diagnosed by LMS. These protocols were analyzed in some detail, followed by individual interviews to determine the nature of the students' difficulties. Results obtained from the protocols and interviews indicate that there are two very  different types of mal-rules at large with algebra students, namely, manipulative (defining a manipulative mal-rule as a variant on a correct rule which has one substage either omitted or replaced by an inappropriate/incorrect operation) and parsing (incorrect representation of a task). Although bug-migration could be explained by repair theory, it appears that this second category of algebra errors (parsing) can best be explained by a mechanism called mis-generalization. (JN)
Basic Algebra Revisited: A Study with 14 Year Olds. Revision.;Sleeman, D.;1984;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"A group of 24 14-year-old students were presented with sets of algebra tasks using the Leeds Modelling System (LMS), a computer-based modeling system. Four months later, these same students were given a paper-and-pencil test which covered comparable tasks set by LMS. In addition, certain students were given detailed diagnostic interviews. A comparison between the results obtained is presented. Results obtained on the paper-and-pencil test and the interviews were consistent, showing that students had some profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation. Furthermore, from the interviews it was possible to determine classes of strategies some students were using, including (1) searching for solutions (substituting) and (2) applying a ""global"" rule, such as collecting all numbers on  one side, whether or not they were coefficients. The overall picture evolving from this and other studies seems to be: (1) that the difficulties of learning algebra have been greatly under-estimated; (2) that students have a great difficulty in inferring their own rules, or sometimes higher-level schema, and then using them consistently and often in appropriate situations; and (3) that few students have evolved mechanisms by which they can verify whether a proposed algorithm is feasible.

An Attempt to Understand Students' Understanding of Basic Algebra.;Sleeman, D.;1984;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;"This paper Reports the results obtained with a group of 24 14-year-old students when presented with a set of algebra tasks by the Leeds Modelling System (LMS). These same students were given a comparable paper-and-pencil test and detailed interviews some 4 months later. The latter studies uncovered several kinds of student misunderstanding that LMS had not detected. Some students had profound misunderstandings of algebraic notation; others used strategies such as substituting numbers for variables until the equation balanced. Additionally, it appears that the student errors fall into several distinct classes: namely, manipulative, parsing, clerical and ""random"". LMS and its rule database have been enhanced as the result of this experiment, and so LMS is now able to diagnose the  majority of the errors encountered in this experiment. Finally, the paper gives a process-orientated explanation for student errors, and re-examines related work in cognitive modelling in the light of the types of student errors Reported in this experiment. Misgeneralization is a mechanism suggested to explain some of the mal-rules noted in this study. (Author)"
A Recursive Theory for the Mathematical Understanding--Some Elements and Implications.;"Pirie, Susan; Kieren, Thomas";1990;;Report;Eric;;Yes;;;;There has been considerable interest in mathematical understanding. Both those attempting to build, and those questioning the possibility of building intelligent artificial tutoring systems, struggle with the notions of mathematical understanding. The purpose of this essay is to show a transcendently recursive theory of mathematical understanding which is based on the consideration of understanding as a nonlinear process of growth. This theory of growth has a built-in dynamic of folding back to move out, but also shows understanding as an organizing process to entail action, perception of action, conception of percepts, conception of concepts, conception of forms (or classes) and logical explanation in an embedded manner. The theory and its elements, and the properties and  applications of the theory are discussed. (CW)

Tutoring Mathematical Word Problems Using Solution Trees: Text Comprehension, Situation Comprehension, and Mathematization in Solving Story Problems. Research Report No. 8.;"Reusser, Kurt; Others, And";1990;;Article;Eric;;Yes;;;;The main concern of this paper is on the psychological processes of how students understand and solve mathematical word problems, and on how this knowledge can be applied to computer-based tutoring. It is argued that only a better understanding of the psychological requirements for understanding and solving those problems will lead to instructional improvement. Introduced first are the major points of a psychological theory of strategic and goal-directed understanding and solving mathematical situation problems derived from work on discourse processing and on work on cognitive simulation related to word problems. Secondly, the psychological and didactic principles, and the techniques used for the development of a computerized tutor designed at helping students to solve complex,  verbally stated, mathematical problems are discussed. Developing partly intelligent tutoring systems may not only serve as a means to provide children with the kind of interactive problem solving and learning environments and instructional tools which have been described as didactic models of scaffolding and coaching, reflective learning, or of cognitive apprenticeship, respectively, but also serve as a means to the more fundamental educational goal of becoming an autonomous or self-directed learner. The computer tutoring program, called HERON, uses an iconic form of problem representation called solution trees or conceptual planning trees, a graphical network format of semantic concepts and mathematical operations, intended to capture the hierarchical structure of solution plans of  multi-step mathematical situation problems. A narrative and graphical description of the program is included. (KR)

AI-Driven Educational Transformation in Secondary Schools: Leveraging Data Insights for Inclusive Learning Environments;"D. Duraes; R. Bezerra; P. Novais";2024;2024 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578910;;Yes;Yes;;In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a progressive trend towards teaching that is more personalised to students' characteristics and some models of prediction failure that are more accurate. In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students. The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands. Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments. In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.

An introduction to machine learning for students in secondary education;"S. D. Essinger; G. L. Rosen";2011;2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting (DSP/SPE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739219;;Yes;;;We have developed a platform for exposing high school students to machine learning techniques for signal processing problems, making use of relatively simple mathematics and engineering concepts. Along with this platform we have created two example scenarios which give motivation to the students for learning the theory underlying their solutions. The first scenario features a recycling sorting problem in which the students must setup a system so that the computer may learn the different types of objects to recycle so that it may automatically place them in the proper receptacle. The second scenario was motivated by a high school biology curriculum. The students are to develop a system that learns the different types of bacteria present in a pond sample. The system will then group the bacteria together based on similarity. One of the key strengths of this platform is that virtually any type of scenario may be built upon the concepts conveyed in this paper. This then permits student participation from a wide variety of educational motivation.
Quantum Computing for High-School Students An Experience Report;"P. P. Angara; U. Stege; A. MacLean";2020;2020 IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00047;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Quantum computing is an emerging field that can revolutionize our ability to solve problems and enable breakthroughs in many areas including optimization, machine learning, chemistry, and drug design. With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the abovementioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed “unplugged” activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter noteBooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university.
Research on Mental Health of Secondary Vocational School Students Addicted to Internet;"D. Yang; Y. Chen; J.

Teachers’ Perspectives on Gender Equity in STEM: Beliefs, Challenges, and Opportunities;"A. Ayuso-Lanchares; N. Merayo";2025;IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje;IEEE;IEEE;10.1109/RITA.2025.3554310;;Yes;;;As the world rapidly digitizes, there is a growing emphasis on engaging young people, particularly girls, in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields where they remain underrepresented. This study investigates the influence of primary and secondary school teachers on students’ STEM engagement within the Spanish education system, with a focus on gender equality. Using a descriptive correlational design, the research gathered responses from 664 teachers, revealing differences in beliefs and practices between primary and secondary educators regarding STEM promotion. The findings indicate that while primary teachers often emphasize career opportunities, secondary teachers focus on explaining STEM study content. Interestingly, only a minority of teachers (30-40%) Report receiving gender equality training, underscoring a need for better teacher education in this area. The study also identifies key gender-related barriers, including stereotypes, lack of female role models, and limited STEM career visibility. These barriers are compounded by societal pressures, leading to fewer women in technology-related studies. The results call for education systems to enhance curricula with gender-sensitive practices and align primary and secondary teaching approaches to cultivate technological interest from an early age. Improved STEM training for teachers, as well as activities that promote female role models, can foster a supportive environment for girls. This study contributes to understanding the role of educators in shaping STEM aspirations and highlights the urgent need for systemic changes to address the gender gap in STEM fields.

Cybersecurity Education in High School: Exploring Cyber Assets, Cyber Value at Risk, and Authentic Assessment;"P. Vajpayee; G. Hossain";2024;2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893209;;Yes;Yes;;In the realm of cybersecurity, a knowledge chasm exists among high school students. High school students face a significant gap in cybersecurity knowledge, essential for safeguarding the digital environment. This educational deficit renders them vulnerable to cyber threats, compromising personal and school-wide digital security. The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals exacerbates the issue, threatening future defenses against cyberattacks. This paper introduces Cyber Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a concept adapted from finance, to evaluate the risk to digital assets. It outlines a model using basic math and probability to assess and mitigate risks to these cyber assets, which include data, vulnerability, and potential negative impacts like financial or reputational loss at the time of cyber incident. The approach equates cyber assets to financial terms-assets, liabilities, and capital-to demonstrate how additional countermeasures can reduce cyber asset value. The paper emphasizes the importance of consistent cybersecurity practices, akin to the effects of compound interest, and aims to demystify cybersecurity for students using financial literacy and mathematical concepts. The paper uses the proposed method to calculate cyber risks for the prominent cyber-attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Data breach, Ransom ware, and loT Vulnerabilities in the context of school. It further explains the value of problem based learning and provides an authentic assessment framework to establish a practical learning of cybersecurity concepts for high school students. Finally, it advocates for the integration of security measures in internet use, covering authentication, authorization, encryption, firewall, secure connections, and systems' upgrade to reduce cyber risks. With the rise of online education, gaming, social media, and digitalization, cyber awareness is crucial for high school students. The criticality of internet security is making cyber knowledge an urgent educational priority. Due to growing demand of loT and artificial intelligence (AI), the paper suggests future research about explaining cyber risks to high school students using machine learning, human behavior, and system anomalies.

Predicting Students’ State Examination Results based on Previous Grades and Demographics;"A. Pentel; L. -L. Kaiva";2020;2020 11th International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/IISA50023.2020.9284401;;Yes;;;All Estonia's upper-secondary school students have three mandatory final state examinations - in mathematics, Estonian language and foreign language. We used data obtained from one school in order to predict student's final examination scores based on previous grades and demographic data. Our aim was to find most important factors that contribute positively to final results and vice versa. Machine learning package Weka was used to build predictive models and with all tested attribute sets we got accuracy over 80% on classification. On continuous models we got mean absolute error close or less to 10, when range of test result was 0-100 points. Most of our attributes were subject grades on scale 1-5, and therefore, as we limited our testing sample with one school only, it gave interesting insights into how some subjects and teachers do contribute to final test results. And, surprisingly, it turned out, that for some test result, most significant predictor was negatively correlated to the result. It means that having bad grades in some subjects was a good predictor of success in final test. Besides being a useful tool for students who want to estimate possible test results beforehand, it is also a useful tool for measuring teachers' contributions and relationships between different subjects.

The goal is to enhance learning by tailoring assignments to students’ linguistic preferences, cognitive styles, and knowledge levels. The system employs machine learning techniques and GPT-based models to create personalized tasks that align with curriculum goals while addressing linguistic diversity, particularly for Tatar-Russian bilinguals. The study evaluates several large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, YandexGPT, and GigaChat, based on their ability to generate math problems and content in the Tatar language. While GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo show superior performance in producing accurate and semantically correct problems, their proficiency in Tatar remains inconsistent. The research underscores the need for further development of LLMs to enhance content generation for bilingual educational contexts and highlights the potential of AI in advancing adaptive learning for mathematics education. Future directions include expanding the system’s functionality and testing its effectiveness across diverse educational settings.

Yang";2024;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TLT.2024.3392830;;Yes;;;"The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited an increase in discussions about generative AI tools in education. In this study, a human-centered learning and teaching framework that uses generative AI tools for self-regulated learning development through domain knowledge learning was proposed to catalyze changes in educational practices. The framework illustrates how generative AI tools can revolutionize educational practices and transform the processes of teaching and learning to become human-centered. It emphasizes the evolving roles of teachers, who increasingly become skillful facilitators and humanistic storytellers who craft differentiated instructions and attempt to develop students’ individualized learning. Drawing upon insights from neuroscience, the framework guides students to employ generative AI tools to augment their attentiveness, stimulate active engagement in learning, receive immediate feedback, and encourage self-reflection. The pedagogical approach is also reimagined; teachers equipped with generative AI tools and AI literacy can refine their teaching strategies to better equip students to meet future challenges. The practical application of the framework is demonstrated in a case study involving the development of Chinese language writing ability among primary students within a K–12 educational context. This article also Reports the results of a 60-h development programme for teachers. Specifically, providing in-service teachers with cases involving uses of the proposed framework helped them to better understand the generative AI concepts and integrate them into their teaching and learning and increased their perceived ability to design AI-integrated courses that would enhance students’ attention, engagement, confidence, and satisfaction."

An important research objective of this field is to predict dropout and improve graduation rates, in particular in STEM higher education.The goal of this study is to identify students at risk of dropping out at a large Hungarian technical university using predictive analytical tools. We use data of 10,196 students who finished their undergraduate studies (either by graduation or dropping out) between 2013 and 2018. We analyze dropout predictability in two main scenarios: first using data available at the time of enrollment, e.g. pre-enrollment achievement measures, and personal details, then in another scenario we supplement this feature set with first-semester performance indicators and use this richer set of attributes for further analysis. We apply artificial neural networks and boosting algorithms for prediction, and examine how the predictive power can be improved by the additional information. In other words, we study the incremental predictive validity of the early university performance indicators on graduation over the pre-enrollment achievement measures and vice versa.

Online Academic Performance during the COVID-19: Evidence from a Rural High School in Western China;"L. Zeng; H. Luo";2021;2021 Tenth International Conference of Educational Innovation through Technology (EITT);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/EITT53287.2021.00030;;Yes;;;Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools in China shifted to online learning in the spring of 2020. For many schools located in the rural areas of western China, however, it was their first attempt at online learning, and the critical question regarding the effectiveness of online learning on academic performance remains to be answered. In this study, we tracked 125 Grade 10 students in a rural high school in western China, and we compared their academic performance before and after the online learning practice. In addition, four hierarchical regression models were computed to explore the influencing factors of post-pandemic academic performance in different subjects. The results indicated that online learning did not increase students' academic performance in the rural high school and significant drop of performance was seen in mathematics and English. Students' demographic features had little influence on the change of academic performance, as prior academic performance remained the most important predictor of the post-pandemic academic performance.
Predicting Dropout in Higher Education Based on Secondary School Performance;"M. Nagy; R.

Predicting the Performance of Mathematics’ Students through Data Mining Techniques for Enhanced Education Systems;"J. Maurício; G. Marques";2021;2021 1st Conference on Online Teaching for Mobile Education (OT4ME);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/OT4ME53559.2021.9638819;;Yes;;;In this study, we use data mining techniques to predict the performance of students in mathematics. The failure rate in secondary education within the discipline of mathematics is significant. Therefore, predicting the performance of students is relevant to support the decision plan on interventions. A dataset with 395 records collected from two secondary schools in Portugal was used in this work. The authors tested eight machine learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Consequently, this work supports future research activities to use NB to predict students’ performance. Moreover, this work has ranked the impact of the variables which most disturb students from achieving success. The results recommend the NB algorithm using the top five important features which Report 75.22%, 74.41%, 75.22%, and 73,29% of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively. By predicting students’ performance is possible to plan interventions on time and, consequently, increase the final discipline score.

It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9–12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter noteBooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth."

The Use of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Smart Classrooms is in Its Infancy;"E. Figueroa; E. Batista; R. Palau; O. Unciti; M. Ferre; A. Martínez-Ballesté";2024;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3454372;;Yes;;;Smart classrooms are physical learning spaces that, using data from the environment, students and teachers, are able to provide timely and valuable information to improve teaching and learning processes and foster decision-making. In this article, we provide an overview of how artificial intelligence techniques are being used to gain insights into the teaching and learning processes by analyzing data not only from the classroom context, but also from students and teachers. We identify the latest literature addressing the use of artificial intelligence techniques with data obtained from the smart classroom, present a taxonomy for the areas of application, review the state of deployment in schools, and discuss the current limitations. From the results, we conclude that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze classroom data in real settings (i.e., primary and secondary schools) is still far from common. Most proposals are in the lower range of technological readiness levels and do not consider issues such as information security and privacy. Furthermore, most proposals focus on the development of technological products and do not address their impact on learning. Our paper concludes with an outlook on future work in this area with the aim of making the smart classroom a cornerstone for the future of education.
Supporting Mathematical Education with Interactive Visual Proofs;"M. Weckbecker; S. Neziri; G.

A Machine Learning and Explainable AI Approach for Predicting Secondary School Student Performance;"K. M. Hasib; F. Rahman; R. Hasnat; M. G. R. Alam";2022;2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference (CCWC);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720806;;Yes;;;An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school Reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working.

Primary and High School Question Classification based on Bloom's Taxonomy;"Hasmawati; A. Romadhony; R. Abdurohman";2022;2022 10th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/ICoICT55009.2022.9914842;;Yes;;;One of the student's abilities that must be measured in the learning process is cognitive ability. This measurement is essential to establish the level of students' understanding of the material that has been taught. Giving questions with the appropriate difficulty level is an attempt to measure these cognitive abilities. According to Bloom's taxonomy, there are six levels of cognitive abilities, remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. An automatic question classifier is helpful for teachers to develop a high-quality question and comply with different cognitive levels. This paper proposed automation question classification using the classical classification method (Support Vector Machine and Multinomial Naïve Bayes) and the pre-trained language model, IndoBERT. We conducted an experiment based on 670 mathematics and Indonesian language questions in primary and high school. The evaluation results show that the best classification accuracy was achieved by the IndoBERT method, which is 82% for classifying mathematics questions and 63% for classifying Indonesian Language questions. We analyzed that the small number of datasets and unbalanced at each taxonomy level affected the classification results.

However, they still have misconceptions and gaps in interpreting language and symbols, and lack understanding of fundamental math concepts, which makes it difficult for them to solve basic or multi-step word problems.
Hands-on Active Learning Approach to Teach Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to Elementary and Middle School Students;"N. Sinha; R. F. Evans; M. Carbo";2023;2023 32nd Wireless and Optical Communications Conference (WOCC);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/WOCC58016.2023.10139678;;Yes;;;The last decade has seen a surge in expanding access to Computer Science (CS) education, especially for K-12, with many states even stipulating student learning standards in CS and Computational Thinking (CT). Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs. We describe a detailed AI/ML lesson plan based on standards and framework, AI4K12 big ideas, art and science of curriculum design, active learning, and culturally responsive and inclusive pedagogy. Then we discuss our experiences in teaching the same to $\boldsymbol{4}^{\mathbf{th}}$ grade students in an elementary school.
ChatGPT, Finances, and Degree Attainment: Increasing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Utilization and Implications for Students' Decision-Making;T. Fletcher;2024;2024 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892857;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Students’ decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.

This research presents Educational eXplainable AI Tool (EXAIT), a system for math quiz recommendations, along with an explanation. EXAIT was implemented in a Japanese public high school where students received the top 5 math problems based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm in a learning analytics dashboard. It aimed to help them complete their summer vacation assignments having 240 questions. On click, the students were redirected to an eBook platform to submit their accuracy and confidence level in each problem. We conducted a study with a quasi-experimental design and divided into 3 groups based on compliance of use. RecoExp group received and used explanations regarding why an item was recommended and how it aims to maximize learners' knowledge-gaining path. RecoCon was the control group that received just the recommendations and used it and RecoNone group did not use the system at all during the time period. We provide a framework to analyze learning logs from EXAIT and extract emerging self-directed learning patterns. Analyzing 222 students' EXAIT logs, we found learners who had checked explanations while selecting recommendations had significantly higher performance. Further differential process mining highlighted significant active daily engagement transitions of the RecoExp group in the self-directed activity.

The Impact of Generative AI on Learning Across Grades;"M. Xie; L. Luo";2025;2025 14th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ICEIT64364.2025.10976022;;Yes;Yes;;The emergence of generative AI (GAI) has significantly impacted education, offering both opportunities and challenges for the sector’ s digital transformation. As the use of GAI in learning grows increasingly prevalent among students, its adoption varies greatly from one individual to another. Despite this growing trend, research on students' use and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. In our study, we employed a mixed-methods, multiple-case study design to explore the impact of GAI on students across four grades. We focused on six key areas: learning interest, independent learning, problem-solving, confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Our results revealed that participants had optimistic expectations regarding the utilisation of GAI to facilitate their learning. They believed that GAI could contribute positively to all six dimensions, enhancing their educational experience. We found that college students exhibited a higher level of performance than high school students across all six aspects. The insights we gained from this study can inform future research in digital education, particularly in understanding the diverse ways in which students interact with and perceive GAI. By recognizing the potential of GAI in transforming education, educators and policymakers can better harness its capabilities to enhance teaching and learning experiences. Additionally, the findings can guide the development of GAI-based educational tools and resources that cater to the needs of students across different grade levels.

Academic Achievement in Mathematics of Higher-Middle Education Students in Veracruz: An Approach Based on Computational Intelligence;"Y. Céspedes-González; A. D. Otero Escobar; J. D. Ricárdez Jiménez; G. Molero-Castillo";2023;2023 11th International Conference in Software Engineering Research and Innovation (CONISOFT);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/CONISOFT58849.2023.00031;;Yes;;;"Given the role that education plays in society; it is important to have a quality education system. In this sense, the academic achievement of students is an indicator that allows measuring the quality of education offered by educational systems. One way to measure academic achievement is through the results of standardized tests, as is the case of PLANEA in Mexico. This research paper presents the analysis of academic achievement in mathematics of high-middle education students in Veracruz, through an approach based on computational intelligence. For this, an unsupervised learning approach based on K-means was used, an algorithm that models a set of input variables and assigns elements (data vectors) with similar characteristics to certain clusters. The solution method was divided into four stages: data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, variable selection, and algorithm application. As a result, a differentiated segmentation was observed for the evaluation period. From this segmentation, some characteristics stand out in each group were identified, such as: the shift, degree of marginalization, support, programmed students and evaluated students."
Algorithmic Bias in a Student Success Prediction Models: Two Case Studies;"F. Xiang; X. Zhang; J. Cui; M. Carlin; Y. Song";2022;2022 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering (TALE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00058;;Yes;;;Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being used in today’s society. However, growth in these algorithms means growth in algorithmic bias, and it is imperative that we work to understand the bias that may result. One area of study in which these algorithms are widely used is in educational institutions. The algorithms are often used to predict student success or retention. In our research, we aim to uncover the biases that may result from building and using a machine learning student success models. To do so, we used two publicly available student datasets from educational settings (one from a MOOC and another one from secondary education in Portugal) and built models of our own. We then compared the accuracy and the fairness of each model type to observe which models performed best on each subcategory of students. Among the models we built, we found that while it is easy to use accuracy to evaluate models and find the most accurate ones, the most accurate predictive model overall for a dataset may not perform fairly in predicting student success for all subcategories of students. To better tune models for fairness, we found that it is possible to tune models that also take fairness into consideration, and these models could perform more fairly on almost all subcategories of students, but it slightly took away from the accuracy of the algorithm. Our results demonstrate the importance of creating and tuning several model types in order to choose a balanced model that balances accuracy and fairness.

Arianto";2024;2024 6th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Education (WAIE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/WAIE63876.2024.00040;;Yes;;;This study aims to analyze the implementation of digital-guided discovery learning for students in boarding schools. Learning carried out in boarding schools is still traditional. The characteristics of the curriculum and students in boarding schools need to develop in the digital learning paradigm. It is necessary to adapt digital technology-based learning to support global demands in the 21st century. This research method uses a quasiexperimental post-test only design. The subjects of the study were 72 students in grade VII of junior high school at the Ibrahimy boarding school. Research data were collected using tests to determine learning outcomes and questionnaires to determine student assessments of the implementation of learning. Findings from the results of the implementation of digital guided discovery learning provide better learning outcome assessments than traditional guided discovery learning. Students tend to like this learning activity although a small number of students still give the assessment that this learning is still difficult for them to do. Students at the Ibrahimy boarding school have succeeded in adapting by using digital learning. These findings are the first step in developing more widespread digital technology-based learning at the Ibrahimy boarding school.
Development of an Early Warning System to Support Educational Planning Process by Identifying At-Risk Students;"M. Skittou; M. Merrouchi; T. Gadi";2024;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3348091;;Yes;;;The development of data analysis techniques and intelligent systems has had a considerable impact on education, and has seen the emergence of the field of educational data mining (EDM). The Early Warning System (EWS) has been of great use in predicting at-risk students or analyzing learners’ performance. Our project concerns the development of an early warning system that takes into account a number of socio-cultural, structural and educational factors that have a direct impact on a student’s decision to drop out of school. We have worked on an original database dedicated to this issue, which reflects our approach of seeking exhaustiveness and precision in the choice of dropout indicators. The model we built performed very well, particularly with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, with an accuracy rate of over 99.5% for the training set and over 99.3% for the test set. The results are visualized using a Django application we developed for this purpose, and we show how this can be useful for educational planning.
Integration of a Chatbot to Facilitate Access to Educational Content in Digital Universities;"B. Babou; K. Sylla; M. Y. Sow; S. Ouya";2024;2024 26th International Conference on Advanced Communications Technology (ICACT);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.23919/ICACT60172.2024.10471975;;Yes;;;Digital universities have been developed in several countries, particularly on the African continent, to meet the need for massification in the higher education sector. However, the lack of physical space is a major drawback, preventing learners from succeeding and increasing the drop-out rate compared with a conventional university. In these digital universities, learners use distance learning platforms to complete their training. For a good training, mastery of the fundamental modules is essential. With the frequent use of messaging applications, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could promote and facilitate access to educational content and enhance their learning experience. In this article, we propose a model for integrating a chatbot that will enable learners to access training modules to increase their knowledge and master core modules through formative skills assessments. The model we propose is based on the use of Machine Learning (ML) with the Rasa open-source framework and the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) platform.

Based on the experimental findings, the hyper-parameterized Random Forest model shows a significant performance with 81% of recall value in identifying a student at the risk of meeting the benchmark level.
An Intelligent Classification Method for Online Teaching Student Performance Data Based on Improved Decision Trees;"H. He; H. Fan";2024;2024 6th International Conference on Computer Science and Technologies in Education (CSTE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/CSTE62025.2024.00041;;Yes;;;At present, the extraction of intelligent classification features of online teaching student achievement data is mostly one-way structure, and the efficiency of classification is low, leading to the smaller F1 value of intelligent classification. This paper proposes the design and verification of the intelligent classification method of online teaching student achievement data based on the improved decision tree. According to the current demand for intelligent classification, the online teaching student achievement data collection is advanced, and the multi-level method is adopted to improve the efficiency of classification and extract the characteristics of multi-level student achievement classification. On the basis of this, an intelligent classification model of online teaching students' performance data is constructed by improving the decision tree, and the intelligent classification of performance data is realized with the help of collaborative filtering. The final test results show that: for the selected five intelligent classification cycles of achievement data, and for the achievement data of junior high school mathematics, Chinese and English, the final intelligent classification F1 values can reach more than 0.85, all close to 1, which indicates that the intelligent classification method designed for online teaching students' achievement data is more efficient, complete and targeted with the help of improved decision trees. It has practical application value.

What is the time taken by the car to reach z miles ahead of y? A high school student probably gets frustrated by questions like these on the ground that inquiries in arithmetic. The idea of implementing hacking on a smart car should improve student’s interest and motivate them to pursue careers in STEM-related areas. However, if the same example was demonstrated to them using a smart car prototype which was hacked, then there is a good chance they can get attracted towards Technology and Computing. When similar examples, involving the various other topics in their syllabus, are shown, they’ll probably get to see the real-life applications of the topics they study during high school and after that. This paper introduces a new attempt that aims at inclining the interest of high school students towards the courses in the STEM (which have an escalating carrier aspect), improving their computational thinking capability, and making them aware of today’s cybersecurity issues.

The SWDCS Research Alliance is a research-practitioner partnership of computer science and special educators. The purpose of this preliminary study is to increase African American and Hispanic students with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and persistence in CS and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers. This project employs a project-based voice user interface (VUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) instruction, and tech mentoring. Of the 21 teachers participating in the Alliance, the research team identified a convenience sample of eight teachers to participate in semi-structured, focus group interviews. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, the researchers identified the following emergent themes: limitations of school or administrative policies for African American and Hispanic SWD enrolling in CS classes, lack of CS-focused interventions for African American and Hispanic SWD, lack of formal teacher preparation for CS teachers to work with SWD, and structural barriers limiting SWD, Hispanic, and Black students' enrollment in CS classes. This study fills the gap in the literature concerning minority SWD's experiences in CS education.
Analyzing Sensitive Factors Affecting Online Academic Performance in the New Normal: A Machine Learning Perspective;"G. S. Lumacad; J. V. C. Damasing; S. B. M. Tacastacas; A. R. T.

Despite the advantages brought by online learning in continuing learners' learning experiences and improving learners' academic performance during the pandemic, it is still of vital importance to examine what factors are sensitive to changes in learner's online academic performance. In this study, sensitive factors affecting online academic performance are examined through the lens of machine learning (ML) methods: Boruta algorithm (BA) for feature selection; multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN) for model formulation; and partial derivatives method (PDM) for sensitivity analysis. Data used in the analysis are responses in the survey participated by N = 978 senior high and junior school students of a private high school institution in the Philippines. Out of eighteen factors considered in the analysis, BA revealed only six relevant factors that contributes greater information to changes in student's online academic performance. Formulated MLP NN model achieved a high testing accuracy of 0.932 with a kappa coefficient of 0.891 and an f - measure of 0.924, that aided the sensitivity analysis using PDM to have better results. Sensitivity analysis showed that motivation and mental well- being are the most sensitive factors affecting both below average and above average online academic performance."

Toward Embedding Robotics in Learning Environments With Support to Teachers: The IDEE Experience;"S. Orlando; E. Gaudioso; F. de la Paz";2024;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TLT.2023.3339882;;Yes;;;Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in using different technologies, such as educational robotics in classrooms. However, in many cases, teachers have neither the necessary background to efficiently use these kits nor the information about how students are using robotics in classroom. To support teachers, learning environments with robotics tools should monitor the students' interaction data while they are interacting with the different resources provided. With the analysis of this data, teachers can obtain valuable information about students' learning progress. In previous work, we presented integrated didactic educational environment (IDEE), an integrated learning environment that uses robotics to support physics laboratories in secondary education. Students' interactions with IDEE are stored and analyzed using the additive factor model to show the teachers the most significant skills in the learning process and those students who have difficulties with these skills. Now, our goal is to enhance the information given to the teachers to allow them to focus on the specific needs of each student on every different skill involved in the activities and not only the significant skills. To this end, we use a conjunctive knowledge tracing model based on a hidden Markov model. In this article: first, we describe how the CKT model has been adapted to the pedagogical model of IDEE, second, we show that this model can identify the skills that each student masters, and thus, support teachers in identifying learning criticalities in students.

Hosein";2022;2022 IEEE International Conference on Technology Management, Operations and Decisions (ICTMOD);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ICTMOD55867.2022.10041877;;Yes;;;Education is a critical pillar of success in life, and every child should have the right to quality education. As such, administrators should make every effort to provide an environment that fosters student success at every level. A crucial assessment period for children in St. Vincent and the Grenadines occurs at the Grade 6 level where students sit the Caribbean Primary Exit Assessment. In this study, we propose several models to predict student performance in Mathematics using diagnostic examination results for Math and English at Grade 2 and Grade 4 levels. We created additional features via a greedy approach to factor in the interactions of the provided features. The models used for prediction include the XGBRegressor, Principal Component Regression, KNN Regression, Lasso Regression, and a DNN. We compared these models using the metrics of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the Co-efficient of Determination (R2). We also performed a number of experiments applying two scalers, StandardScaler and QuantileTransformer. We obtained the best performance using the XGBRegressor model with an RMSE, MAE and R2 of 9.71%,7.59% and 61.56% respectively.
gPhysics—Using Smart Glasses for Head-Centered, Context-Aware Learning in Physics Experiments;"J. Kuhn; P. Lukowicz; M. Hirth; A. Poxrucker; J. Weppner; J. Younas";2016;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TLT.2016.2554115;;Yes;;;Smart Glasses such as Google Glass are mobile computers combining classical Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) with several sensors. Therefore, contact-free, sensor-based experiments can be linked with relating, near-eye presented multiple representations. We will present a first approach on how Smart Glasses can be used as an experimental tool for head-centered, context-aware, wearable-technology-enhanced, and inquiry-based learning in physics education. Therefore, we developed an app that is based on the Google Glass platform and designed to perform educational physical experiments on the topic of acoustics. Its initial application is intended for high-school students whose task is to study the relationship between the frequency of the sound generated by hitting a glass of water and the amount of water in the glass. The core idea is to have Google Glass automatically measure both the water fill level with the camera and the sound frequency with the microphone, and incrementally generate a fill level/frequency graph in the HMD. We designed an educational setting and studied its effect on cognitive and affective variables with an intervention-control-group design. While the intervention group analyzed the fill level/frequency relationship with the Google Glass platform, control group 1 worked on the phenomenon using the same platform implemented on a tablet PC. Control group 2 analyzed the phenomenon using a tablet PC with a typical mobile-based education platform. We used a two-way ANCOVA to study learning outcome, wondering, curiosity, cognitive load, and experimentation time as dependent variables of 46 high-school eighth-graders together with group membership and gender influence as independent variables. While the positive effects of using Google Glass as a mobile lab on wondering and curiosity as well as a positive trend for experimentation time were detected, no differences were analyzed for learning achievement. Although students have a higher cognitive load when working with Google Glass compared to other devices, the cognitive load level is very low in general.
Fostering Student Competencies in Creative Project Work Through STEAM and Artificial Intelligence in Teaching Art;"F. Kulanova; D. Baitureev; C. P.

Zhong";2022;2022 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering (TALE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/TALE54877.2022.00043;;Yes;;;Reinforcement learning (RL), as a promising approach to realize Artificial Intelligence (AI), has been widely applied in developing robots. However, the current K12 Robotics Course is still designed to focus on traditional robot technology without RL. In order to foster the transition between education and industries, a robot course integrating RL is designed in our research. We implemented the course and carried out case studies in a robot course in a school and an experience class for K12 students. The results show that most students can successfully complete the robot task based on RL under reasonable course difficulty, and most students agree the proposal of teaching RL in K12 Robotics Course. This suggests researchers and policy makers to work on updating K12 Robotics Course by adding RL section, thus to keep the AI curriculum system and content modern.

Comparisons with related research showed consistent outcomes, underscoring the credibility and importance of the employed predictive models.
A Visualized Hybrid Keyword-Cluster Approach for Extractive Text Summarizer Tool for STEM Education in Malaysia;"S. Alias; M. Majalin; N. Hayatin";2023;2023 IEEE 8th International Conference On Software Engineering and Computer Systems (ICSECS);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ICSECS58457.2023.10256370;;Yes;;;Summary generated from an automatic text summarization tool has become increasingly relevant due to the shift towards online learning caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we present an extractive educational text summarizer tool with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) subjects specifically designed for secondary school students in Malaysia. The tool addresses the challenge of understanding complex STEM concepts from lengthy explanations and problem-solving scenarios. We propose a new hybrid method for scoring the keywords by leveraging the word embeddings technique to improve the keyword extraction cluster approach. The generated summaries are displayed with highlighted cluster of keywords and illustrated using word clouds to attract students' interest and engage them with the subject matter. We compare our proposed method to the benchmark and baseline Malay text summarizer using random STEM articles. The ROUGE-l results produced an average F-Score of 56.8%, precision of 56.3% and recall of 58.1%. We also conducted a System Usability Testing with teachers and secondary school students, obtaining high ratings for system simplicity, pleasant interface, and ease of information retrieval. Our study demonstrates the potential of educational text summarization tools to enhance student learning experiences in diverse contexts.
SurvBeNIM: The Beran-Based Neural Importance Model for Explaining Survival Models;"L. V. Utkin; D. Y. Eremenko; A. V. Konstantinov; V. A. Muliukha";2025;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3537459;;Yes;;;A new method called the Survival Beran-based Neural Importance Model (SurvBeNIM) is proposed. It aims to explain predictions of machine learning survival models, which are in the form of survival or cumulative hazard functions. The main idea behind SurvBeNIM is to extend the Beran estimator by incorporating the importance functions into its kernels and by implementing these importance functions as a set of neural networks which are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Two strategies of using and training the whole neural network implementing SurvBeNIM are proposed. The first one explains a single instance, and the neural network is trained for each explained instance. According to the second strategy, the neural network only learns once on all instances from the dataset and on all generated instances. Then the neural network is used to explain any instance in a dataset domain. Various numerical experiments compare the method with different existing explanation methods developed for survival analysis, in particular, for models SurvBex, SurvNAM, and SurvLIME. Results of experiments with synthetic and real data show that the proposed method outperforms existing explanation methods. A code implementing the proposed method is publicly available.
A Prediction Model to Improve Student Placement at a South African Higher Education Institution;"T. Abed; R. Ajoodha; A. Jadhav";2020;2020 International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA48453.2020.9041147;;Yes;;;There is a growing concern over the low pass rates of students in the Science Faculty at a South African Higher Education institution. The Admission Point Score (APS) used to place students into programs may appear to have good discretion in gauging student aptitude, but the reality is that between 2008 and 2015, about 50% of students who met the APS requirements for a Science program failed to meet the requirements to pass. This Report attempts to build a recommendation engine that will advise students on their academic trajectory for a chosen program based on features suggested by the Tinto (1975) framework [1]. The results show that classification models from various archetypes of machine learning have good accuracy in predicting the final outcome of a new student. This research argues that a more complex view of student placement will improve the faculties success rates.

The following paper shows the pilot concept of integrating an EEG device into a modern proposed learning model to support and assess it.
Computational Thinking Between Philosophy and STEM—Programming Decision Making Applied to the Behavior of “Moral Machines” in Ethical Values Classroom;A. M. Seoane Pardo;2018;IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/RITA.2018.2809940;;Yes;;;"This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines,"" using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences."
Machine Learning in Higher Education: Students’ Performance Assessment Considering Online Activity Logs;"G. Latif; S. E. Abdelhamid; K. S. Fawagreh; G. B. Brahim; R. Alghazo";2023;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3287972;;Yes;;;"Machine learning in Education is receiving more attention from researchers as the number of students at all levels globally is increasing. To ensure students’ success in K-12 educational institutions and higher education institutions work needs to be done to assist students, teachers/professors, parents, and all stakeholders to provide the support that students need. The need and motivation for such systems are very well-established and thus the aim of this work is to develop a system based on modified machine learning models to automatically predict students’ performance and subsequently identify students at risk. The DEEDs dataset is used in this study. Novel features were extracted and applied to well-known classifiers some of which are ensemble classifiers. These classifiers were also combined with base learners such as bagging and boosting. The problem was divided into three scenarios; binary classification of the pass and fail, three class scenarios, and four class scenarios. It was shown that ensemble methods combined with base learners of boosting and bagging significantly increase the accuracy for binary classification, slightly increase accuracy for three class problems, and have no significance in increasing the accuracy when the problem is 4 classes. The ensemble algorithm of bagging and boosting FDT achieved an accuracy of 98.25% for binary classification and 89.47% for three classes. The standard ensemble FDT achieved an accuracy of 77.19% for four classes. The results obtained for binary classification were compared with results Reported in the extant literature using the same dataset proving that the proposed modified algorithms achieved better results than similarly proposed methods. The three-class and four-class results could not be compared because according to the author’s knowledge, there are no research papers published for the same dataset for multi-class classification."

Predicting examination performance using machine learning approach: A case study of the Grade 5 scholarship examination in Sri Lanka;"U. M. Ranawaka; C. Rajapakse";2020;2020 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/SCSE49731.2020.9313029;;Yes;;;Universal primary school education is a must requirement and one of the criteria that should be fulfilled by the developing countries according to the International development goals which are also recognized as “Eight Millennium Development Goals” In the context of Sri Lanka, Government is mostly involved in primary education through government-controlled schools. The success of primary education is measured by conducting a scholarship examination. Those who are getting higher results are given opportunities to attend well-facilitated schools for secondary education. Due to that case, there is a massive competition for passing the examination. Limitless pressure for examination provides lots of issues to students. This paper uses data to investigate a model of academic performance as measured by past results of school tests of Grade 4 and Grade 5. 500 students from eight primary schools in the Gampaha district have been selected for collecting data. The Data on the above-mentioned students have been collected by conducting questionnaires to the teachers who in-charged the classes. Then the Logistic Regression model and Multiple Linear Regression model have been applied to predict students' performances at the examination. The model depicts the likelihood of a student passing or failing the grade 5 scholarship examination and predicts the range of results that students will obtain in the examination. The accuracy of predictive models is measured using the results of students who have already faced the Grade 5 examination. Revealing the potential of students at the grade 5 examination is heavily benefited by teachers because they can provide personalized education for talented students and provide opportunities to other students to improve their talents. The initial architecture of the Grade 5 examination results' predictive model is being discussed in this paper.

A Conceptual Model to Identify Vulnerable Undergraduate Learners at Higher-Education Institutions;"N. Mngadi; R. Ajoodha; A. Jadhav";2020;2020 2nd International Multidisciplinary Information Technology and Engineering Conference (IMITEC);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/IMITEC50163.2020.9334103;;Yes;;;There is a growing concern around student attrition worldwide, including South African universities. More often than not, the reasons for students not completing their degree in the allocated time frame include academic reasons, socio-pschyo factors, and lack of effective transition from the secondary education system to the tertiary education systems. To overcome these challenges, the tertiary educational institutions endeavor to implement interventions geared toward academic success. One of the challenges, however, is identifying the vulnerable students in a timely manner. This study therefore aims to predict student performance by using a learner attrition model so that the vulnerable students are identified early on in the academic year and are provided support through effective interventions, thereby impacting student success positively. Predictive machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, decision trees, and logistic regression, were trained to deduce the students into four risk-profiles. A random forest outperformed other classifiers in predicting at-risk student profiles with an accuracy of 85%, kappa statistic of 0.7, and an AUC of 0.95. This research argues for a more complex view of predicting vulnerable learners by including the student's background, individual, and schooling attributes.
HANDS: enHancing Academic performaNce via Deep foreSt;"Y. Ma; H. Qiao; X. Sheng; X. Wang; Z. Li";2022;2022 15th International Conference on Human System Interaction (HSI);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/HSI55341.2022.9869490;;Yes;;;Student performance prediction plays a critical role in numerous educational scenarios, e.g., academic early warning and personalized teaching. A large body of researches have been developed for better learning gains through leveraging plentiful student-related information, such as students' historical course grades and demographical data. Recent years, campus smartcards have been widely used in most of Chinese universities, and a large amount of students' behavioral data can be recorded in an unobtrusive style, which provides a new perspective for us to predict students' academic performance. Different from most of traditional approaches, in this study, we try to exploit students' campus behavioral data, and present a novel approach for student performance prediction, namely as HANDS (enHancing Academic performaNce via Deep foreSt), which introduces decision tree-based deep learning method into establishing the predictive models. Particularly, benefiting from end-to-end learning style of deep learning, the proposed HANDS method can automatically extract students' behavioral characteristics and predict their academic performance. And thus it can save expensive human labor cost, compared with handcrafted feature-based approaches. Experimental results on a real-world data set demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods.

DRONEscape: Designing an Educational Escape Room for Adult AI Literacy;"D. DiPaola; J. Shen; R. Hu; S. Alghowinem; C. Breazeal";2023;2023 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/CoG57401.2023.10333148;;Yes;Yes;;Escape rooms have become increasingly popular as a form of entertainment, in addition to being adopted by educators for their effectiveness in improving student engagement and learning. While they have been introduced in various educational contexts, from nursing to mathematics, and for different age groups, including K-12 and university students, little research has been conducted on the benefits of escape rooms for adult learning of artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, most escape room implementations lack relevance to real-world situations and challenges with using AI systems in the wild. This study explores the effectiveness of an escape room, DRONEscape, as a tool for teaching AI concepts to Air Force participants. The results suggest that escape rooms can most effectively facilitate engagement and collaboration, and have positive effects on learning AI concepts. This paper also provides considerations for improvements to future iterations of AI-themed escape rooms to enhance learning, collaboration, engagement, and enjoyment.
On the Evaluation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Hyperspectral Image Classification on a Heterogeneous Computing Device;"N. Pereira; J. Plaza; J. M. Haut; A. Plaza";2021;2021 16th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.23919/CISTI52073.2021.9476225;;Yes;;;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems collect electromagnetic radiation, emitted or reflected by the scene under observation at, typically, hundreds of contiguous and regularly spaced narrow spectral bands, from the visible to the infra-red region of the spectrum. The result is a 3D data cube with two spatial dimensions and a wavelength dimension, composed of hundreds of co-registered images containing information on the spectral signature of the materials present in the field of view of the sensor at the time of capture. Retrieving this information in an efficient way, requires compute systems capable of dealing with a huge amount of data and complex algorithms. The recent development of single board computers (SBC) with enough compute power to deal with HSI processing using machine learning (ML) algorithms opens new opportunities for embedded HSI systems for Earth Observation remote sensing, laboratory setups and industrial applications. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the ODROID-XU4, a heterogeneous computing device, running ML algorithms for HSI classification. The experimental results show the potential of SBC as alternative hardware platforms for applications requiring low power and low cost devices, such as onboard processing units and edge computing.

In the context of product-related data, trend product detection is a specialized tool or software that is specifically designed to identify trends in sales, customer preferences, product reviews, and other relevant data points. The study focuses on the combination of trend detection and sentiment analysis as a powerful approach for trend spotting. In this paper, we present a study that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the VADER sentiment analysis tool to identify product sentiment from customer reviews. We then applied decision tree analysis to predict whether a product is likely to trend or not based on its sentiment score. Additionally, we used clustering to group the top-rated products based on their sentiment scores and applied a moving average to determine which products are currently trending. Our results show that the combination of trend detection and sentiment analysis can effectively identify trending products with an accuracy of 93%. This study demonstrates the power of NLP and sentiment analysis in detecting trends and provides valuable insights for businesses to make data-driven decisions about their product offerings.
Predicting Student Dropout Rates in Massive Open Online Courses Using an Attention-Based GCNN Model;"B. S; S. Mann; A. Thangam; V. R. Dubey; B. V; N.

Economic growth, employment prospects, competitiveness, and productivity are all hindered by educational failures and school dropout rates, which impact not only higher education institutions but also students, families, and society at large. A systematic technique consisting of three essential steps is followed in this work. The first step is to collect the dataset, and then for each data point, preprocessing methods are put up. Here, we focus on variables like gender, previous academic performance, and sessional marks, and we transform and handle missing values as part of the data selection process. The importance of the feature scores is then determined using a feature selection procedure. Lastly, an Attention-based GCNN method outperforms more traditional methods like GCN and ACNN while training the model.
Future Educational Technology with Big Data and Learning Analytics;"R. Kanth; M. -J. Laakso; P. Nevalainen; J.

The application of these emerging research areas is gradually addressing the contemporary challenges of school and university education. Tracing out the information regarding students' misconceptions and dropping-out probabilities from the courses at the right instant of time, development of detectors of a range of educational importance and achieving the highest level of quality in the higher education are becoming more challenging. Moreover, providing well timed and the best suitable solutions to the students at-risk are even more strenuous. In this concept paper, we aim to address these contemporary challenges of school and the university education and their probable solutions by utilizing our research experiences of automated assessment, immediate feedback, learning analytics and the IT technologies. Solving such problems by knowing the history of students' activities, submissions, and the performances data is possible. The identification of students' misconceptions during the learning process, examining behavioral patterns and significant trends by efficiently aggregating and correlating the massive data, improving the state-of-the-art skills in creative thinking and innovation, and detecting the drop-outs on-time are highlighted in this article. We are aiming at extracting such knowledge so that adaptive and personalized learning will become a part of the current education system. Not only the available algorithm of supervised learning methods such as support vector machine, neural network, decision trees, discriminant analysis, and nearest neighborhood method but also new engineering and distillation of relevant data features can be carried out to solve these educational challenges.

There are historical reasons why there is a high drop-out rate, these reasons stem from the Apartheid era and how it had an impact on our education system. In this study we aim to shed light on whether the marks that students anticipate achieving are aligned to the marks that they obtain on assessments. Examining this link could shed light on whether first-year students have realistic views of the academic demands at university. This is done by training 6 different models namely Bagging, Random Forest, Decision table, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Multi-Layer Perceptron. All the models are trained using a K-Fold cross validation K=5 to achieve a 80:20 split of training and test data. The best performing model is the Logistic Regression model with 0.692982 accuracy but with the problem in had it is found that the best model to use is the Decision table due to it’s ability to classify students that failed the year with a recall of 0.719 for class ”Fail”.

However, there is an increasing call for transparency and understanding into how the results of complex models are derived, leading to explainable AI gaining attention. The application of machine learning to automated group formation for collaborative work from learning system logs and other data has been progressing. Building on previous research in this field, we propose a group formation method that is based on a combination of course knowledge structures, reading behavior, and assessment analysis to create optimal heterogenous and homogeneous working groups using a genetic algorithm. The characteristics of each group are presented for explanation as a visualized knowledge map showing the strengths and weaknesses of each group, and are in the structure form of curriculum. We also present a case study of applying the method to junior high school mathematics log data, and provide explanation in a visualized form of standardized curriculum of group characteristics that are often referenced for learning design by teachers.
Developing Motion Editor for 3D Printed Humanoid Robot by VTK and Python;C. -T. Hsieh;2022;2022 International Conference on Fuzzy Theory and Its Applications (iFUZZY);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/iFUZZY55320.2022.9985225;;Yes;;;For satisfying the needs of Industry 4.0, STEM education gradually becomes important. The STEM education provides courses to educate students in four disciplines, i.e. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, transforming current industry to a modern industry needs the support from a group of professional people who are familiar with the core technologies of ID 4.0, such as virtual and real Integration systems, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence(AI). Programming is the key to make the above industrial revolution success. Thus, our previous project developed a low cost humanoid robot as a learning tool applied in STEM programs. With the assistance of the humanoid robot, young students can learn programming courses easily and efficiently. Currently, STEM education is often applied in elementary, junior-high and senior-high schools. It really improves students' learning circumstance in STEM fields. This paper introduced the STEAM education model to create a good learning circumstance for art students. Digital teaching aids, such as humanoid robot, and quadruped mechanical animal, support students to learn STEM programs more intuitively. Those aids can help students to learn mechanical mechanisms, electronic motors, digital control and programming and so on. These teaching aids are all open source, and they can be printed by 3D printers. Students can learn mechanics, electronics, and programming via the course. In order to enable students to use the humanoid robot digital teaching aids more effectively and completely, a humanoid robot motion editor is developed. This editor was developed by python and VTK, and it also has a friendly window-based interface. Its main task is to provide students to edit the motion of the robots quickly and easily. Through this editor, students can learn more about multi-foot and humanoid robot motions.
Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Approach to Classifying Learning Modalities Under the New Normal;"G. S. Lumacad; R. A. Namoco";2024;IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TCSS.2023.3251566;;Yes;;;Because of community quarantines and lockdowns during COVID–19 times, the Philippine’s Department of Education (DepEd) implemented blended learning (BL) [both online and offline distance learning modalities (LM)] among basic educational institutions in the hope of continuing learners’ learning experiences amidst the pandemic. Learners’ LM are classified through the use of an Algorithm for Learning Delivery Modality as recommended by DepEd. Based on initial investigation, mismatches in learners’ LM were, however, observed, resulting in learners’ massive shifting from one LM to another in the middle of the school year. In this study, we introduced an approach to classifying learner’s LM using machine learning (ML) techniques. We compared the effectiveness of five ML classifiers, namely the random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP NN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Learner’s enrolment and survey form (LESF) data from the repository of a local private high school in the Philippines is used in model formulation. We also compared three existing feature selection (FS) algorithms (recursive feature elimination (RFE), Boruta algorithm (BA), and ReliefF)–integrated into the five ML classifiers as data feature reduction techniques. Results show that the combination of MLP NN and BA yielded a considerably high performance among the rest of the formulated models. Sensitivity analysis revealed that asynchronous LM is most sensitive to “existing health condition” feature, modified asynchronously, is highly characterized by low educational attainment and unstable employment status of parents or guardians, while synchronous learners have high socio–economic status as compared to other LM.

This work aims to overcome the limitations of traditional RSs by introducing an innovative approach that seamlessly integrates sentiment analysis (SA) into recommender system techniques. The primary goal is to enhance the performance of SA and improve the reliability and accuracy of user recommendations. The suggested framework comprises of three essential steps: SA, where the Bi-GRU technique is utilized to assess the emotional context within user reviews; the generation of personalized recommendations; and the seamless integration of sentiment analysis into the recommendation system. A comprehensive evaluation conducted on a Musical Instruments dataset demonstrates significant improvements in evaluation metrics. The Bi-GRU technique achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 89%. User-based recommendations using SA yield an RMSE of 1.83 and an MAE of 1.71. Additionally, item-based recommendations result in an RMSE of 2.18 and an MAE of 2.00. This pioneering approach represents a substantial contribution, promising more reliable and precise user recommendations, ultimately enhancing overall user satisfaction and the user experience."

Enhancing the Admissions Process for Engineering Baccalaureate Programs: A Machine Learning Approach to Developing a Valid and Reliable Examination;"M. S. Ramos; J. R. B. Barajas; P. J. N. Gealone; N. O. Aspra; O. M. Padua; A. T. Lucero";2023;2023 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium (SIEDS);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137793;;Yes;Yes;;This paper details an approach to identify multiple-choice questions that are most effective in discriminating deficiencies in mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students who are graduates of the K-12 program that was recently implemented in the Philippines. To achieve this objective, machine learning algorithms such as the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were implemented. From a question bank containing 1,300 questions covering Algebra (A), Advanced Algebra (AA), Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (T), Analytic Geometry (AG), and Solid Mensuration (SM), five domain experts identified the suitability of the questions as part of a diagnostic examination in mathematics. Specifically, using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being the highest), the experts rated the suitability of each question to test the proficiency of a student in 23 mathematics competencies based on what is prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The collected survey data were then used to train the machine learning models, which extracted patterns to identify the questions that would be most suitable to test the mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students. With a precision recall score of 99.90%, the LR model was selected as the best performing model and analysis of how the LR model predicts the labels through the use of shap values revealed that the preference was given towards questions which test student proficiency in foundational mathematics competencies like that of Algebra and Analytical Geometry. Overall, these findings provided a better understanding of the questions that are most effective in discriminating student deficiencies in mathematics subjects.
Contribution to attendance and fraud management in engineering schools and digital universities with Deep Learning;"K. Sylla; B. Babou; S. Ouya";2023;2023 3rd International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ICECCME57830.2023.10252290;;Yes;;;Facial recognition is applied in many sectors, including education. In fact, in engineering schools, where one of the major challenges is to train students in different sectors of activity, the presence of students is fundamental during these courses, unlike in faculties where attendance is not mandatory during lectures. In the face of massification in digital universities, the management of attendance and fraud during evaluations becomes fundamental to the credibility of the diplomas issued. This paper presents an artificial intelligence-based facial recognition system for attendance and fraud management in engineering schools and digital universities. Attendance and exam fraud management play a very important role in the training of learners. The use of this system saves a lot of time by eliminating the attendance management step by automating it while detecting fraud during exams. The solution consists of a student, course and schedule management application coupled with a facial recognition system. It detects the presence of learners during scheduled lessons and assessments through facial recognition.
Empowering Knowledge With Virtual and Augmented Reality;"O. Gervasi; D. Perri; M. Simonetti";2023;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3342116;;Yes;;;Recent global advancements in ICT technologies have motivated our research to assess the impact of Virtual and Augmented Reality on teaching and learning. In particular, we conducted a rigorous study on the effects on learning by subjecting classes of students to an experience of these emerging technologies and measuring their feelings before and after the experiment through questionnaires. We carried out the research involving three high schools and a total of 162 students aged between 15 and 20. During the meetings, we made available two applications that we developed. The first is a Virtual Reality environment that enables the user to explore a room in which the system spawns three-dimensional objects defined by the teacher. The objects may represent mathematical functions, physics simulations, scenes relating to historical re-enactments, etc. The second is an Augmented Reality smartphone application that allows three-dimensional figures to be observed via the smartphone screen by framing a marker printed on paper. Both applications are realised with free software, trying to minimise the technical requirements for their operation and guaranteeing reliability and usability. The work concludes by analysing the results obtained and comparing the effectiveness of the two technologies tested. Results of tests conducted in three Italian schools show that Augmented Reality is seen as a useful tool in education by about 94.43%. Importantly, the use of these technologies requires an inclusive design that involves all students, regardless of their level of familiarity with the technology. The overall analysis reveals that both technologies performed well, and students value them for their intuitiveness and level of immersion. The in presence experience is more effective for using immersive applications fostered by student collaboration.
A Method for Knowledge Representation to Design Intelligent Problems Solver in Mathematics Based on Rela-Ops Model;"H. D. Nguyen; N. V. Do; V. T. Pham; A. Selamat; E. Herrera-Viedma";2020;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2988929;;Yes;;;Knowledge-base is a fundamental platform in the architecture of an intelligent system. Relations and operators are popular knowledge in practice knowledge domains. In this paper, we propose a method to represent the model by combining these kinds of knowledge, called the Rela-Ops model. This model includes foundation components consisting of concepts, relations, operators, and inference rules. It is built based on ontology and object-oriented approaches. Besides the structure, each concept of the Rela-Ops model is a class of objects which also have behaviors to solve problems on their own. The processing of algorithms for solving problems on the Rela-Ops model combines the knowledge of relations and operators in the reasoning. Furthermore, we also propose a knowledge model for multiple knowledge domains, in which each sub-domain has the form as the Rela-Ops model. These representation methods have been applied to build knowledge bases of Intelligent Problems Solver (IPS) in mathematics. The knowledge base of 2D-Analytical Geometry in a high-school is built by using the Rela-Ops model, and the knowledge base of Linear Algebra in university is designed by using the model for multiple knowledge domains. The IPS system can automatically solve basic and advanced exercises in respective courses. The reasoning of their solutions is done in a step-by-step approach. It is similar to the solving method by humans. The solutions are also pedagogical and suitable for the learner's level and easy to be used by students studying 2D-Analytical Geometry in high-school and Linear Algebra in university.
Fairness-Aware Maximal Cliques Identification in Attributed Social Networks With Concept-Cognitive Learning;"M. Tao; F. Hao; L. Wei; H. Zhi; S. O. Kuznetsov; G. Min";2024;IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TCSS.2024.3445721;;Yes;;;Attributed social networks are pervasive in real life and play a crucial role in shaping various aspects of society. These networks not only capture the connections between individuals but also encompass the associated attributes and characteristics. Analyzing and understanding these attributes provide insights into social behaviors, information diffusion patterns, and the formation of influential communities. Consequently, we propose a novel algorithm for detecting fairness-aware maximal cliques in the attributed social networks. We extract the concept lattice of attributed social networks and quantify these concepts using the concept stability and fairness measures defined in this article. By utilizing the proposed fairness-aware distance, we identify fairness-aware maximal cliques within attributed social networks. The effectiveness of the algorithm is then validated using five real-world network datasets. Experimental results fully demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in identifying key structures, analyzing attribute networks, and promoting the development of responsible computational systems.
Pandemic and Natural Disasters Driving the Need for AI Driven NEXTGen Medical Services;"D. Marimekala; J. Lamb";2022;2022 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ISEC54952.2022.10025292;;Yes;;;Our pre-pandemic Medical services were primarily focused on providing health services in person and less on using the virtual methods. The pandemic has changed the landscape of medical services, as a greater number of patients are using alternate methods for medical services such as telemedicine, Virtual Assistance and video conferencing to communicate with the physicians and healthcare providers. As a result, there is a shift in the paradigm on how these services are being catered to different age groups. IT has played a vital role in keeping up with the increasing demands during the pandemic and natural disaster. There has been a constant effort from the business, healthcare providers and IT industry to provide simplicity and ease in usage of alternative methods so that all age groups can communicate to physicians, healthcare workers and healthcare providers easily. This change has brought in new ways of providing services to patients of all age groups. During the pandemic there was little hope of finding the vaccination for Covid-19. Medical researchers and Scientists were constantly working on finding breakthroughs. In this period the IT services, Artificial intelligence, Hybrid Cloud, Security and Compliance, automation and cognitive analysis paved a way for researchers and scientists to reach a breakthrough in finding a vaccine. In this paper we study the importance of Medicine, Technology and Energy for mankind.
Towards Software-Defined Buffer Management;"K. Kogan; D. Menikkumbura; G. Petri; Y. Noh; S. I. Nikolenko; A. Sirotkin; P. Eugster";2020;IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/TNET.2020.3011048;;Yes;;;Buffering architectures and policies for their efficient management are core ingredients of a network architecture. However, despite strong incentives to experiment with and deploy new policies, opportunities for changing anything beyond minor elements are limited. We introduce a new specification language, OpenQueue, that allows to express virtual buffering architectures and management policies representing a wide variety of economic models. OpenQueue allows users to specify entire buffering architectures and policies conveniently through several comparators and simple functions. We show examples of buffer management policies in OpenQueue and empirically demonstrate its impact on performance in various settings.
Output Feedback Tracking Consensus of Switched Stochastic Uncertain Multiagent Systems via Event-Triggered Control;"J. Cai; C. Yi; X. Luo; C. Xiao";2025;IEEE Systems Journal;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/JSYST.2024.3511914;;Yes;;;This article explores the adaptive event-triggered output consensus control problem for a class of switched stochastic multiagent systems (MASs) with unmeasured states and unknown nonlinearity. First, in order to overcome the limitations facing the average dwell-time method of consensus for switched MASs proposed in the existing works, the adaptive control protocol within the framework of mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) is introduced to expand the scope of applications. Furthermore, through a novel gain-scheduled state observer, the fuzzy logic systems are applied to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions. The dynamic surface design method is used to remove the need for derivative calculations of the constructed virtual controls, significantly the complexity of calculations. In addition, under the framework of backstepping design, the switching threshold event-triggered control strategy is developed to effectively decrease the communication load and balance the performance of MASs. The proposed control protocol ensures that all signals within the closed-loop systems are ultimately bounded under the MDADT switching property. Finally, the simulation results are obtained to validate the proposed control mechanism.
Research on Knowledge Graph Extraction Methods for Chinese STEM Curriculum;"C. Wang; X. Sang; X. Wang; Y. Gao; Y. Liu";2024;2024 7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (MLNLP);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/MLNLP63328.2024.10800180;;Yes;Yes;;STEM education, as an innovative teaching model, has gained widespread attention in recent years. However, the lack of relevant textBooks and learning resources has made its implementation challenging. Developing interdisciplinary knowledge graphs tailored for STEM education has become an urgent issue. To address this, a knowledge extraction framework named Llms4edu is proposed, which utilizes a series of effective prompts to guide large language models in knowledge extraction. Specifically, the knowledge extraction task is transformed into multiple rounds of question-and-answer interactions with the LLM, gradually identifying entity-relation triplets from subject data. Through experiments, an F1-score of 89.4% was achieved on the named entity recognition task in the chemistry subject, and an F1-score of 66.7% on the relation extraction task. Finally, a subject ontology model was built for subject text, and a subject data set was constructed using Llms4edu, which includes three subjects of junior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry, a total of 2,511 entities, 2,010 relationship triples, and cross-disciplinary knowledge is linked to construct a cross-disciplinary knowledge graph.
Student performance predictor using multiclass support vector classification algorithm;"S. S. Athani; S. A. Kodli; M. N. Banavasi; P. G. S. Hiremath";2017;2017 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication (ICSPC);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/CSPC.2017.8305866;;Yes;;;Educational data mining provides the process of applying different data mining tools and techniques to analyze and visualize the data of an institution and can be used to discover a unique pattern of students' academic performance. Secondary schools are increasing rapidly from past years and progress of the institution can be measured based on student's success and failure rates. Failure rates can be measured in terms of a core subject such as mathematics which has been considered in this proposed system. Real data was collected using school Reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used for the project. The students will be classified according to the grades assigned for the range of marks scored by them. This involves classifying the students into five levels of grading system starting from grade `A' to grade `F' where grade `A' represents the student getting the highest marks, grade `B' being the second highest, grade `C' being third, grade `D' being the fourth and the grade `F' which implies that the student has failed. To carry out this type of classification many machine learning algorithms can be used to implement it. Comparison was made between the algorithms like Multiclass Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks using the Weka tool. Based on the analysis carried out Multiclass Support Vector Machine showed prominent accuracy. The Multiclass Support Vector Machine is implemented on the basis of one-to-rest strategy use of class labels which is primarily an extension of linear Support Vector Machine. In order to get appropriate results in terms of the accuracy of the model, parameters like `C' and `Gamma' is tuned while implementing Multiclass Support Vector Machine. The result gives a good predictive accuracy based on the grades that are provided by the school. The accuracy of prediction made by Support Vector Machine Classifier is determined by using K-fold cross validation, according to which the accuracy is 89%.
Fuzzy-Deep Learning-Based Artificial Intelligence for Edge Computing and Real-Time Decision-Making in Uncertain IoT Environments;"B. P. Joshi; A. Singh; N. Kumar; S. Rautela";2025;2025 First International Conference on Advances in Computer Science, Electrical, Electronics, and Communication Technologies (CE2CT);IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/CE2CT64011.2025.10941321;;Yes;;;Owing to the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) quick growth, both academics and the sector have paid close emphasis to vehicular edge computation (VEC). Nevertheless, because of the unbalanced congestion and the strict delay requirements, task offloading in various junction situations continues to struggle from inefficient resource allocated and poor operation implementation standards. This study proposes a task-offloading technique using a fuzzy decision-making method to deal with ambiguity and uncertainties to solve these problems. Roadside Utilities (RSUs) placed alongside remote roadways typically have limited energy resources, thus they must offer energy-effective planning assistance with the distribution of duties to VEC. However, planning decisions for regional task execution incur computational costs, and assigning duties to edge automobiles incurs transmission costs, making energy usage management difficult. Task data transmission to edge automobiles results in increased RSU power usage even while task offloading lowers response delay. To meet task schedule and supply restrictions, this study proposes an energy-effective automobile planning issue for offloading functions to mobile edge units. This study develops a planning technique depending on on-policy deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a fuzzy-based DRL to address the extremely complex problem brought on by a rise in the number of automobiles under RSU service. When contrasted to the Q-learning method, this FRL not only speeds up the learning procedure but also enhances long-term payoff.
What is the role of physical location in our online social networks?;"Gabriel Pui; Cheong Fung; Kai-On Chow; Tak-Lam Wong";2012;2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics;IEEE Conferences;IEEE;10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359544;;Yes;;;One of the most important properties of social media is its reachability - we can reach any user in any corner of a social media network regardless of the actual physical location of the users. Conceptually, this reachability should be able to help us expand our social networks to some extent because we can make friends without any physical interaction (but with cyber interactions only). There are no physical constraints in social media. While we agree with the above concept, we are curious of how this reachability property shapes our online social networks. Specifically, if physical location is no longer a barrier and physical interaction can be ignored when making friends online, then our online social networks should at least have the following two characteristics: (1) a certain number of friends are from different places in the world, and (2) a certain number of friends are not from our physical social circles (i.e., they are not our colleagues, not our high school friends, etc). In this paper, we aim at analyzing the role of physical location in online social networks. To conduct the analysis, we use FaceBook, one of the largest social media sites to-date, as our data source. We crawl more than 2 million user profiles and study them in detail. To our surprise, we found that physical location still plays a critical role in our online social networks.
Transformer-Based Embeddings for Greek Language Categorization;"C. M. Liapis; K. Kyritsis; I. Perikos; M.

Handling numerous user queries manually can be challenging, necessitating the development of an automated system for accurate categorization of these queries. This paper presents a comparative study of various transformer-based models for multi-class text categorization of Greek language queries submitted to the GSN helpdesk. We introduce a new experimental balanced dataset and extract vector representations from eleven transformer-based models. These representations are evaluated using ten classic machine learning classifiers. Our findings highlight the superior performance of the Multilingual E5 Text Embeddings model, particularly when paired with the extreme gradient-boosting classifier. This combination demonstrates a clear advantage in accurately categorizing user queries, paving the way for more efficient automated helpdesk systems.
Traffic Prediction of Wireless Cellular Networks Based on Deep Transfer Learning and Cross-Domain Data;"Q. Zeng; Q. Sun; G. Chen; H. Duan; C. Li; G. Song";2020;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025210;;Yes;;;Wireless cellular traffic prediction is a critical issue for researchers and practitioners in the 5G/B5G field. However, it is very challenging since the wireless cellular traffic usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing wireless cellular traffic prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of wireless cellular traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. To improve the accuracy of 5G/B5G cellular network traffic prediction, more cross-domain data was considered, a cross-service and regional fusion transfer learning strategy (Fusion-transfer) based on the spatial-temporal cross-domain neural network model (STC-N) was proposed. Multiple cross-domain datasets were integrated. The training accuracy of the target service domain based on the data characteristics of its source service domain according to the similarity between services and the similarity between different regions was improved, so the predictive performance of the model was enhanced. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the traffic prediction model is significantly improved after the integration of multiple cross-domain datasets, the RMSE performance of SMS, Call and Internet service can be improved about 8.39%, 13.76% and 5.7% respectively. In addition, compared with the existing transfer strategy, the RMSE of the three services can be improved about 2.48%~13.19%.
Routing Clustering Protocol for 3D Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Fragile Collection Ant Colony Algorithm;"T. Zhang; G. Chen; Q. Zeng; G. Song; C. Li; H. Duan";2020;IEEE Access;IEEE Journals;IEEE;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982691;;Yes;;;Compared with two-dimensional wireless sensor networks (2DWSNs), three-dimensional wireless sensor networks (3DWSNs) have higher node energy consumption and weaker load balancing. To alleviate these problems, we propose a new multi-hop routing clustering protocol for a wide range of 3DWSNs. In terms of clustering, nodes will run for cluster head (CH) by timing broadcast based on their remaining energy and their average distance from surrounding nodes. Two new identity nodes are added between the CH and the member nodes, the load transfer node responsible for transferring the energy consumption of the CH, and the secondary cluster head node (SCH) acting as the CH for the next round. In order to reduce energy consumption in key node areas, we also enable key nodes to communicate directly with the sink node. In the aspect of routing construction, SN generates the routing table corresponding to each CH through our proposed fragile ant colony algorithm. Because CH and SCH exist at the same time and have a certain replacement order, the SN only needs to obtain the location of each CH when the network is first clustered, and can continuously generate a new routing table corresponding to the CH, which reduces the energy consumption of the network in the routing path construction. We simulate this protocol, LEACH protocol, AZ-SEP protocol, and UCNPD protocol in a three-dimensional environment. The results show that this protocol is better than the other three protocols in terms of network lifetime and network load balance, respectively.
Combining Large Language Models with Tutoring System Intelligence: A Case Study in Caregiver Homework Support;"Venugopalan D.; Yan Z.; Borchers C.; Lin J.; Aleven V.";2025;15th  International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2025;Conference;Scopus;10.1145/3706468.3706516;;;Yes;;Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics. Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The Effect of AI-Based Systems on Mathematics Achievement in Rural Context: A Quantitative Study;"Khazanchi R.; Di Mitri D.; Drachsler H.";2025;Journal of Computer Assisted Learning;Article;Scopus;10.1111/jcal.13098;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Background: Despite educational advances, poor mathematics achievement persists among K-12 students, particularly in rural areas with limited resources and skilled teachers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States. Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups. Implications: The findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings. © 2024 The Author(s).

Board 424: What Works: Intra-Institutional Partnerships and Processes for S-STEM Recruitment;"Smith T.F.; Hatipoglu K.; Cunningham K.J.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"Scholarships in Science Technology Engineering and Math (S-STEM) is a national program administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The purpose of the S-STEM program is to provide scholarships and programming to recruit, retain and graduate low-income scholars in STEM disciplines. S-STEM offers grants in three tracks: Track 1, Institutional Capacity Building; Track 2, Implementation by a Single Institution; and Track 3, Inter-Institutional Consortia. Currently, West Virginia University Institute of Technology (WVU Tech) has a Track 1 S-STEM project and is participating in an accelerator grant program administered by a Track 3 project at Virginia Tech. Recruitment for S-STEM programs can be a challenge. To combat this challenge, the present study is part of a larger initiative to investigate intra-institutional partnerships and share findings broadly to help ensure that no eligible S-STEM scholars are overlooked in future S-STEM program recruitment efforts. Institutional partners at WVU Tech included the S-STEM principal investigators, financial aid, the Student Success Center where first year advising occurs, enrollment management where admissions is housed and university relations where marketing and communications is housed. The current study focused on efforts to recruit S-STEM scholars over two recruitment cycles. To better understand current recruitment efforts, institutional partners and current S-STEM scholars responded to reflection prompts about their experience with recruitment. The sample included all institutional partners and 13 out of 14 scholars. The authors analyzed the written reflections using thematic content analysis with most findings relating to (1) factors in awareness and decision making, (2) reasons for applying, (3) hesitancies and potential barriers and (4) future opportunities and communication strategies. The study revealed that staff perspectives regarding what worked for students did not necessarily align with student perspectives. Students were informed and influenced both internally by institutional partners and externally by relatives and high school teachers. There was not one form of communication that was clearly most effective. Rather, each mode of communication (the website, emails, print materials and word of mouth) played an important role in reaching different groups of potential scholars. These and other findings from the study can provide guidance for future S-STEM and related programs to help ensure that partnerships are leveraged effectively, and recruitment efforts are successful. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

Teaching the Specialized Language of Mathematics with a Data-Driven Approach: What Data Do We Use?;"Fissore C.; Floris F.; Conte M.M.; Sacchet M.";2025;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-73741-1_4;;;Yes;;Numerous studies in Mathematics Education have shown that among the causes of disciplinary learning difficulties are the acquisition and understanding of its specialized language. Data-Driven Learning (DDL) is a didactic approach that treats language as data and sees students as researchers doing guided discovery activities. The exploration of corpora can effectively support reflection on the specialized languages of Mathematics. What data should be used? Students daily use the most recent Large Language Models (LLM) and Google, which can be used for linguistic investigations. However, it must be remembered that there is no total control over the data on which searches are carried out, the results, and the type of language they use. Control over the data is important, especially when teachers want to use these tools to design and deliver didactic activities. This paper presents a recent DDL research activity with 80 secondary school students on the specialized language of Mathematics. The students conducted linguistic investigations on a specially designed corpus and carried out corpus-based activities with automatic formative assessment within a Digital Learning Environment. The results show that the students appreciated the proposed activities. They develop linguistic and mathematical skills and become more aware of the importance of the language they use. Students developed digital skills in browsing, searching, and filtering data, as well as in evaluating data, information, and digital content. LLM, such as ChatGPT, could not be used for the same type of activity, but with appropriate design, they can be used as a starting point for investigation and linguistic reflection. In the future, given the notable diffusion of these AI tools, it is essential to train teachers and students on their strengths and weaknesses and how they influence teaching and learning. © The Author(s) 2025.

This study explores differences in online course perceptions between STEM and non-STEM students and how these perceptions influence their intentions to enroll in future online courses. A sample of 1245 students was recruited from a diverse range of majors, with 44 % of students majoring in STEM. Relative to non-STEM majors, STEM students felt that online classes offer lower performance outcomes, are less enjoyable, and offer less flexibility while requiring more effort. These perceptions explain 74 % of the variance in intentions to enroll in online courses. Differences among STEM sub-categories were also examined to provide a nuanced picture of students' experiences in online courses. The findings identify strategic improvements for online STEM courses by targeting learning-based performance, flexibility in course modality, and students' enjoyment. © 2024
Predicting Long-Term Student Outcomes from Short-Term EdTech Log Data;"Gao G.; Leon A.; Jetten A.; Turner J.; Almoubayyed H.; Fancsali S.; Brunskill E.";2025;15th  International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2025;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3706468.3706552;;;Yes;;Educational stakeholders are often particularly interested in sparse, delayed student outcomes, like end-of-year statewide exams. The rare occurrence of such assessments makes it harder to identify students likely to fail such assessments, as well as making it slow for researchers and educators to be able to assess the effectiveness of particular educational tools. Prior work has primarily focused on using logs from students full usage (e.g. year-long) of an educational product to predict outcomes, or considered predictive accuracy using a few minutes to predict outcomes after a short (e.g. 1 hour) session. In contrast, we investigate machine learning predictors using students' logs during their first few hours of usage can provide useful predictive insight into those students' end-of-school year external assessment. We do this on three diverse datasets: from students in Uganda using a literacy game product, and from students in the US using two mathematics intelligent tutoring systems. We consider various measures of the accuracy of the resulting predictors, including its ability to identify students at different parts along the assessment performance distribution. Our findings suggest that short-term log usage data, from 2-5 hours, can be used to provide valuable signal about students' long term external performance. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Integrating Generative AI (GAI) into math education shows promise for bridging the gender gap in K12 math learning. This study proposes an innovative pedagogy and platform that enables students to create math stories powered by GAI, enhancing their conceptual understanding of key mathematical ideas. The platform was implemented in two K5 schools to evaluate its effectiveness and mechanism (N = 86). Pre- and post-intervention surveys and usage logs indicated significant improvements in students' learning outcomes regarding Math Question (MQ) skills and Math Story (MS) skills. Bayes SEM further modeled the mechanism: students' creating math stories powered by GAI significantly improves MS, which further improves MQ. We further found female students were significantly more engaged in creating stories on this platform and gained more improvement on MQ than male students. The results suggest that AI-powered math story creation can be an effective tool for deepening students' mathematical learning outcomes and has the potential to mitigate the gender gap. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Activity log data from the AdaptiveMath platform was merged with school sociodemographic data from the public MySchool database. The final analytic sample comprised of 66,451 Australian high school students across 304 schools in Years 7–10, who used the AdaptiveMath ITS platform in 2023. Structural Equation Modelling was employed to examine both the direct and indirect effects of school socioeducational advantage and rurality on student usage of the AdaptiveMath platform, and the resulting student learning outcomes. This study finds marginal, but statistically significant relationships between ITS usage and learning outcomes, and the socioeducational advantage and rurality of a student's school. Students who are from more affluent and urban schools use the ITS platform earlier in their school career, for more years, and have higher learning outcomes than their rural, less affluent peers. Further, ITS usage was found to mediate the relationship between socioeducational advantage and rurality, such that it amplified the positive effects of socioeducational advantage, and the negative effects of rurality, upon learning outcomes. The results suggest that introducing ITS platforms into Australian mathematics teaching will not reduce achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged schools. Rather, a Matthew Effect may be observed, whereby students attending privileged schools use ITS platforms more effectively, thereby contributing to an even greater disparities in learning outcome. © 2025 The Authors
Impact of Summer Camp on Minority High School Students on STEM Career Perceptions;"Qasrawi A.; Sulbaran T.; Langar S.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In today's rapidly evolving technological age, the role and relevance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education cannot be understated. For the US, the quality and breadth of its STEM education will shape its future role on the global stage, driving innovation and addressing pressing challenges from Artificial Intelligence to climate change resilience, advancing healthcare, agricultural solutions, and others. However, the country lacks active participation from young minds in STEM fields. This problem is particularly true for students who are minorities, economically disadvantaged, or from rural areas due to the existence of multiple barriers. Although numerous summer camps have been employed to some degree of measurable success to facilitate a positive outlook toward STEM career choices for some time, limited studies investigate how such summer camps impact female students from Rural Independent School Districts (R-ISD), especially the ones that are few hours from the country's southern border. Further, summer camps offer students exceptional opportunities to engage in learning experiences, explore advanced technologies, establish meaningful connections with like-minded peers, and better understand future career choices. Therefore, given the benefits of intervention via summer camps and the lack of research in the identified geographical region, this research aimed to determine the impacts of summer camps developed on a previously published framework to determine if the intervention enhanced the participant's STEM and soft skills, knowledge, future career, and educational choices of female students from R-ISD. The participating students were subjected to a pre-test to determine the baseline at the beginning of the summer camp. A post-test was conducted at regular intervals to measure the summer camp's impacts on the knowledge, future career, and educational choices of participating female students from R-ISD. Both pre and post-tests were conducted online using Qualtrics, as it allowed for quicker data collection and value. The findings indicate a change in the female participant's outlook after the summer camps. Therefore, as the country solidifies its position as a global STEM powerhouse, tapping into the potential of all its citizens is paramount. Our study suggests that targeted interventions, such as summer camps, can play a significant role in this endeavor, particularly for underserved demographics. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.
RICE AlgebraBot: Lessons learned from designing and developing responsible conversational AI using induction, concretization, and exemplification to support algebra learning;"Li C.; Xing W.; Song Y.; Lyu B.";2025;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100338;;;Yes;;The importance and challenge of Algebra learning is widely recognized, with students across the U.S. facing difficulties due to the subject's complexity. While extensive research has focused on enhancing Algebra learning in K-12 education, the reusability, scalability, and effectiveness of the strategies employed (e.g., manual interventions and digital tutoring platforms) remain limited. Conversational AI (ConvAI), enabled by the advancement of large language models (LLMs), emerges as a potential tool for automatic, personalized, and effective student support. However, ethical concerns surrounding diversity, safety, sentiment, and stereotype associated with ConvAI are prominent, and empirical studies examining its application in education are scarce. The purpose of this study is to develop a ConvAI system that mitigates the potential ethical concerns and empirically evaluate the effect of such a system for math learning. Specifically, we first examined computational strategies to mitigate the ethical concerns of ConvAI in educational setting with educational big data (npretraining = 2,097,139) and found that researchers could effectively enhance ConvAI responsibility through the investigated algorithmic strategies. Then, a ConvAI system was constructed using these strategies, guided by learning sciences principles. Lastly, we examined students' eye-tracking patterns, acceptance, and learning processes when using this ConvAI system to learn Algebra through a random experiment (nparticipant = 151). Participants using the developed ConvAI demonstrated generally increased visual attention levels as compared to the control group. Moreover, participants expressed a positive acceptance towards the ConvAI technology. Finally, participants' interaction patterns with the ConvAI technology influenced their Algebra learning. These results provide insights for both educational researchers and practitioners to integrate ConvAI in learning environments. © 2024 The Authors
Board 160: Empowerment in STEM Day: Introducing High School Girls to Careers at National Laboratories (Work in Progress);"Bose B.; Rachbauer L.; Rios E.D.; Dukes F.M.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In the US, women are still vastly underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers, and various studies have shown that girls' interest in STEM careers wane as high school progresses. With this challenge in mind, Empowerment in STEM Day was organized by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), hosting 47 high school students from 6 public high schools in the area. This one-day event was designed and executed through a collaboration between the Women's Support and Empowerment Council (WSEC) and the K-12 STEM Education and Outreach Program at LBNL. The main goal of this program was to provide high school girls, who have little access to STEM career role-models in their immediate surroundings with insights into how a career in STEM looks like. Invitations to participate in the program were sent out to six local high schools in the Bay area asking educators to identify female students that were interested in STEM. Each high school participant was provided with an opportunity to experience a national laboratory environment, learn more about summer workshops and paid summer research internship opportunities at LBNL for high school students, and engage directly with LBNL's employees through job shadow, career mapping and speed networking sessions. In this paper, we will present an overview of the event organization, challenges faced during planning and execution of the event, discuss the lessons learned from the first Empowerment in STEM Day and suggest strategies for incorporating such events at other national laboratories and academic institutions as part of a vital effort into recruiting and retaining more high school girls in STEM-based careers. Additionally, since this was the first in-person event hosted by LBNL's K-12 Program after the pandemic, we will also share the strategies implemented at the event so as to engage both remote and on-site employees as volunteers. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

Predictive analytics in educational outcomes: Analyzing high school students' performance in mathematics;"Dwivedi D.N.; Mahanty G.";2024;Adaptive Learning Technologies for Higher Education;Book chapter;Scopus;10.4018/979-8-3693-3641-0.ch013;;;Yes;;Using a large dataset that includes students' grades, demographic information, and other educational variables from three American high schools, this research work investigates the predictive modeling of students' mathematical performance. Gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch subsidy status, standardized test results (math, reading, and writing), and course enrollment in test preparation are all part of the dataset. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between students' socioeconomic status and their mathematical achievement and to discover important predictors of this achievement using sophisticated machine learning algorithms such as ensemble methods, decision trees, and linear regression. A more complex picture of the factors that lead to mathematical achievement can be gained from the study, which uncovers illuminating relationships across demographic variables, educational interventions, and academic results. The results highlight the promise of predictive analytics for developing individualized plans to improve students' educational experiences. Educators, legislators, and future researchers can benefit from data-driven methods of educational planning and decision-making, which is highlighted in the paper's examination of the findings' ramifications. © 2024, IGI Global.

Using artificial intelligence in education: decision tree learning results in secondary school students based on cold and hot executive functions;"Escolano-Perez E.; Losada J.L.";2024;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications;Article;Scopus;10.1057/s41599-024-04040-y;;;Yes;Yes;Improving educational quality is a universal concern. Despite efforts made in this regard, learning outcomes have not improved sufficiently. Therefore, further investigation is needed on this issue, adopting new perspectives (conceptual and analytical) to facilitate the understanding and design of effective actions. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of executive functions (considering both cognitive and affective processes) and their interactions on learning outcomes in Language and Literature and Mathematics in Spanish students, through the use of artificial intelligence, based on the machine learning approach, and more specifically, the decision tree technique. A total of 173 students in compulsory secondary education (12–17 years old) from the same educational institution participated. The school’s educational counsellor provided information on student executive function levels by completing the BRIEF2 questionnaire for each participant. She also Reported on the learning outcomes achieved by students in the subjects of interest for this research (Language and Literature and Mathematics). R software was used to model the regression trees. The results revealed groups of students characterised by different profiles, i.e., by different combinations of difficulties in various executive functions and varying levels of learning outcomes in each academic area. However, regardless of the academic area considered (Language and Literature or Mathematics), working memory was identified as the most relevant executive function in all of the students’ learning outcomes. Understanding the combination of executive functions that predict learning outcomes in each group of students is important since it enables teachers and other educational professionals, policymakers and researchers to provide individualised educational resources according to the diverse student profiles and needs. It constitutes an effective mechanism to improve students’ learning results and, ultimately, to enhance an equitable and more effective educational system. © The Author(s) 2024.

Research and analysis of deep learning based computer technology combined with mathematical modelling;Wang Q.;2024;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3695080.3695107;;;Yes;;With the development and advancement of modern information technology, mathematics education has also undergone great changes. The classroom presents a wide range of modern information technology used to support student learning. The use of technology software not only enriches teachers' teaching tools and supports them in their teaching activities with technology, but also provides a better learning environment for students. The new teaching materials produced to meet the new curriculum reform, in the case of the new NPCA version, have a wide variety of technical software and a large percentage of them. It is evident that great importance is attached to the use of appropriate information technology in the mathematics classroom. This experimental study is guided by theory. Firstly, the author investigates examples of the effective integration of information technology in the classroom by finding relevant information on the current use of Matlab software in the classroom. The current status of students' learning of exponential and logarithmic functions is then investigated to analyse the current problems in learning functions. Interviews are conducted with outstanding teachers to understand the current state of teaching exponential and logarithmic functions from the teacher's perspective. The investigation and analysis lead to the identification of topics for research: graphs and properties of exponential functions, graphs and properties of logarithmic functions, and approximate solutions to equations by the dichotomous method. Guided by constructivist learning theory and knowledge transfer theory, the Matlab software is designed to incorporate the teaching process of exponential and logarithmic functions. Two classes from Hefei H Secondary School were used to carry out teaching, analyse the effects of the experiment and reflect on the shortcomings. Artificial Intelligence (Artificial nteliqence), or Al for short, is a new technical science that researches and develops theories, methods, technologies and application systems for simulating, extending and expanding human intelligence. Artificial Intelligence is the study of the use of computers to simulate certain human thought processes and intelligent behaviours (e.g., learning, reasoning, thinking, planning, etc.), mainly including the principles of computer-implemented intelligence, the manufacture of computers similar to the intelligence of the human brain, so that computers can achieve a higher level of application. Artificial intelligence will involve the disciplines of computer science, psychology, philosophy and linguistics. Artificial Intelligence is an important part of the discipline of Intelligence, and research in this area includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, natural language processing and expert systems.  © 2024 ACM.
"Analysis and comparison of generative AI and mathematics teachers’ answers to an euclidean geometric problem; [Análisis y comparación de respuestas aportadas por IA generativa y por profesores de matemática a un problema de geometría euclidiana]";"Corica A.R.; Parra V.; Sureda P.; Schiaffino S.; Godoy D.";2025;Educacion Matematica;Article;Scopus;10.24844/EM3701.05;;;Yes;;This work aims to shed some light on the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in solving mathematical problems and its impact on the teaching profession. The conceptual framework adopted throughout this work is Problem Based Learning. The answers to a problem offered by GAI models and mathematics teachers are explored, analyzed and compared. The problem studied belongs to euclidean geometry, and it is characterized by not admitting a single and immediate answer. It consists of dividing a circle into three surfaces of any dimension but with equal area. The categories for analysis are type of cut, representation system, level of mathematical validation and resolution type. We concluded that GAI offers inconsistent responses, little variety of answers, with few mathematical validations and with a predominance of a colloquial representation system. The teachers’ answers are correct, they offer a great variety of partitions, the predominant representation systems are geometric, graphic and arithmetic ones, and they offer some type of validation. It is concluded that the use of GAI models are not appropriate for this type of problems, without any critical reasoning. © 2025 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

Investigating School Principals’ Burnout: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Stress, Sustainability, and Organizational Climate;"Sibisanu R.; Cseminschi S.; Ionica A.; Leba M.; Draghici A.; Nassar Y.";2024;Sustainability (Switzerland);Article;Scopus;10.3390/su16167016;;;Yes;;Chronic stress, culminating in burnout, evolves gradually and is notoriously difficult to detect due to vague symptoms and individuals’ hesitances to acknowledge their struggles. To expedite the identification and recognition of this condition, enabling timely psychological intervention, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being considered. This research does not assert the feasibility of an AI system managing all aspects of chronic stress’s impact. However, it highlights the capability of current technology to detect stress indicators based on quantifiable data like Heart Rate (HR) and organizational climate dimensions. Although other physiological markers such as oximetry, skin galvanic response, and EKG have been explored, they have not shown reliable differentiation between stress and joy. Focused on the unique context of school principals in the Bedouin region of Israel, this study investigates the interplay between HR, organizational climate, and stress levels. It introduces a novel application of a fuzzy logic tool that combines HR and organizational climate metrics to aid in stress diagnosis. This tool incorporates the psychologist’s expertise to provide real-time data crucial for developing effective coping strategies. While the AI-supported fuzzy system does not replace professional psychological intervention, it significantly enhances the speed of condition identification and intervention planning, thus shortening the response time to stress-related issues in educational leadership within culturally specific settings. The application of such AI-driven tools is pivotal for sustaining the well-being and effectiveness of educational leaders, thereby supporting the broader goal of educational sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.
The More Anxious, the More Dependent? The Impact of Math Anxiety on AI-Assisted Problem-Solving;"Chen F.; Chen J.; Xu Y.";2025;Psychology in the Schools;Article;Scopus;10.1002/pits.23500;;;Yes;;"Although the use of AI technology driven by anxiety has become increasingly common, research on the relationship between high school students' math anxiety and their intention to use AI for problem-solving remains limited. This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, aims to explore the relationship between math anxiety and the intention to use AI for solving math problems among high school students. Using the Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the AI Problem-Solving Behavior Scale (AIPS), data from 391 high school students were collected. The analysis revealed the following: (1) Students Report high levels of math anxiety and a strong inclination to use AI tools for solving math problems; (2) Social support plays a significant role in alleviating math anxiety, with family support being the most effective, followed by support from friends and teachers; (3) High levels of family support are the most effective means of reducing math anxiety. The study suggests that the relationship between math anxiety and AI use intention should be addressed, with a focus on regulating the application of AI in math education to promote its scientific and effective use. Additionally, improving family relationships and providing mental health support are recommended to alleviate math anxiety from an emotional and social support perspective. This study provides valuable insights for educators and policymakers, offering important references for designing more human-centered and effective educational interventions, thereby promoting the application of artificial intelligence technology in mathematics education. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
Board 211: Building a'Project-Based Learning for Rural Alabama STEM Middle School Teachers in Machine Learning and Robotics' RET Site (Year 2);"Gong X.; Marghitu D.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--46779;;;Yes;;"This paper is based on a longitudinal project funded by the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science grant. The primary objective of this project is to develop an RET Site under CISE at Auburn University (AU) in Alabama. The title of the research project is ""RET Site: Project-Based Learning for Rural Alabama STEM Middle School Teachers in Machine Learning and Robotics"", and this project provides engaging research experiences to middle and high school science teachers from primarily rural and underserved school districts in Alabama. In-service teachers (7th and 8th grade) participate in a 6-week summer professional development program with an emphasis on machine learning and AI. In addition, to the summer professional development institute teachers lead a weeklong summer camp for middle school students where they have an opportunity to implement curriculum modules they have developed and the project team provides support for teachers to implement the curriculum modules during the academic year as well. Providing consistent support and professional development for teachers in underserved school districts is essential for preparing students with the 21st century skills they will need to engage in an increasingly technological society. This is also essential for broadening participation in STEM for students from traditionally underrepresented populations. Engaging teachers' innovative content (e.g. AI, machine learning, robotics) enhances their pedagogical content knowledge and provides them the skills to better prepare their students to become scientists, engineers, innovators, and entrepreneurs in these areas. As part of this RET project, teachers explore various research topics alongside faculty mentors' and learn how to connect their science and mathematics objectives to machine learning, mobile robot, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality concepts and develop curriculum modules using this content. Teachers also engage with science education researchers to better understand how to make the science content more relevant to their students' daily lives. Teachers enhanced their knowledge in inquiry-based, hands-on research pedagogical strategies and structured and designed their lessons through a lens of project-based learning. Key to this project was demonstrating how leveraging an innovative platform of ML-based mobile robots can be friendly and easily accessible to teachers. This project also fosters strong collaborations between in-service teachers, and engineering and STEM education faculty. Program participants for yr2 included seven teachers, one male and six females. Of the seven teacher participants four identified as African American, two identified as white, and one participant identified as biracial. Surveys instruments included the Project Knowledge Scale, the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS), Computer Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale all used to measure teachers' knowledge, attitudes, computer, and teaching self-efficacy changes pre and post surveys were disseminated to program participates during the summer 6-week professional development institute. Research findings indicated that teacher participant knowledge, attitudes, computer self-efficacy, and teaching self-efficacy increased slightly after the summer professional development institute. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."
Unlocking the Power of Play: Exploring Key Influences of Digital Game-Based Learning Adoption Among South African Mathematics Teachers;"Saal P.E.; Mdlulwa N.; Hannan S.";2025;Computers in the Schools;Article;Scopus;10.1080/07380569.2024.2405518;;;Yes;;Integrating digital game-based learning (DGBL) into mathematics teaching has gained significant attention for its potential to improve learning outcomes. However, adopting DGBL in mathematics remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained contexts such as South Africa. Consequently, this study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate mathematics teachers’ adoption of DGBL in their classrooms. We interviewed twenty-four primary and secondary school mathematics teachers in the Northern Cape province about their use of DGBL. Inductive thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data. The findings revealed that external variables such as language barriers, teachers’ technophobia, parental influence, and students’ limited reading skills negatively influenced teachers’ perceived usefulness of digital games. We also found that the teachers’ attitudes toward DGBL, which were influenced by their positive perception of it, influenced their intention to use digital games for mathematics purposes. The study recommends targeted policy interventions, including the development of multilingual digital tools and comprehensive professional development programs, to enhance the adoption of DGBL among South African mathematics teachers. © 2024 The Author(s).

The study employs gradient boosting methodology, known for its high predicting performance and ability to capture non-linear relationships within data, and adjusts for variables related to the socio-demographic characteristics of the students and their previous educational achievements. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the enrollment choices based on previous high school achievements. The findings shed light on the complex interplay of academic proficiency, gender, and high school background in shaping students’ choices regarding university education, with implications for educational policy and future research endeavors. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.
The affordances and constraints of mathematics tutoring in immersive, collaborative, and dynamic virtual reality environments;"Walkington C.; Sherard M.; Daughrity L.; Pande P.; Beauchamp T.; Cuevas A.";2025;Virtual Reality;Article;Scopus;10.1007/s10055-025-01122-3;;;Yes;;Unprecedented investments are being made in mathematics tutoring interventions for K-12 students, but results from these interventions are not always promising. Traditional online or distance math tutoring can treat learning as disembodied, and not give learners access to embodied resources like gestures, movements, and actions. Virtual Reality offers important opportunities for students joining from a distance to utilize virtual bodies in a fully immersive world, where students can also interact with dynamic mathematical objects. In the present study, we examined 20 middle school students engaging in a VR-based distance tutoring intervention over 7 weeks. We found some preliminary promising indications for the effect of the intervention on students’ mathematical learning, compared to a control group which received VR-based tutoring in English-Language Arts. By systematically qualitatively coding videos of students and tutors engaged in math tutoring, we identified affordances of the VR environment—including the use of gestures and whole-body movements related to students' mathematical reasoning, the presence of mathematical play in the environment, and unique interactions with dimensionality in the 3D space. We also found important constraints from our thematic coding of the interactions in the videos—including connection problems, issues with spatial orientation and virtual body positioning, and off-task or distracted students in the VR environment. We close with recommendations for future VR-based tutoring interventions. © The Author(s) 2025.
Exploratory research on understanding university students’ artificial intelligence literacy in a Korean university;"Lee Y.-J.; Oh J.; Hong C.";2024;Online Journal of Communication and Media Technologies;Article;Scopus;10.30935/ojcmt/14711;;;Yes;;This study explored university students’ perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and AI education. Specifically, the authors sought to understand the level of AI literacy among university students, the extent of their prior exposure to AI education, and the factors that affect their AI education. The study was conducted through an online survey distributed among 300 university students at a Korean university. The study findings indicate that most university students are interested in learning AI. Moreover, the results showed that students with prior experience with software (SW) education showed superior knowledge, a better grasp of AI concepts, and more confidence in using AI technologies, especially in computer coding skills. On the other hand, students with less exposure to prior AI education expressed a need for more learning opportunities and sufficient knowledge of computer coding skills. In addition, we found that students who had received SW education during their K-12 schooling showed better math skills than those who had only received short-term training in university. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the educational barriers that impede university students’ ability to harness this interest effectively. In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into university students’ perceptions regarding AI literacy and the factors that affect their AI education. © 2024 by authors.
A Pilot Program to Introduce Augmented Reality to Female Hispanic High School Students in STEM Education;"Qasrawi A.; Sulbaran T.; Langar S.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Augmented Reality (AR) allows users wearing special glasses (such as Microsoft HoloLens 2, Apple Vision Pro, Trimble XR-10, Oculus Quest 2, Vuzix Blade, etc.) to see and interact with information generated by a computer overlaid on the real world.AR's interactive, immersive, and engaging features could transform learning experiences, particularly for female students drawn by these features.The problem motivating this paper is that females make up only 34% of the workforce in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM).Therefore, as part of this research, Augmented Reality was introduced to female Hispanic high school students with the objective of 1-Identifying students' familiarity with AR, 2-Identifying students' initial impression, 3-Capturing the challenges encountered while using AR, 4-Capturing participants' interest for AR use for an extended period, and 5-Assessing potentials of AR to enhance learning and education among female students.A pre-experimental research design, more specifically, a one-shot case study, was used to introduce STEM using AR (Trimble XR-10 with HoloLens 2) to a group of female Hispanic high school students from rural high schools during a summer camp.After the STEM activity using the AR, the participants completed an online survey with mainly closed-ended questions.The research results are encouraging as all female Hispanic high school students who participated in the activity believed that AR has the potential to enhance their STEM learning and education experiences.The two features that stood out the most were visual quality and interactivity.All participants indicated that AR enhanced their understanding of the topic.The results of this research are vital as there is a growing trend towards the use of AR in STEM fields and STEM education, but limited knowledge exists about the challenges encountered by females when experiencing the AR environment especially when females perceive AR differently than males.The preliminary findings highlight the need for improvements in comfort and user interfaces.AR has the potential to transform education with further research and refinement, which are essential for successful integration into learning environments. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

Board 284: First-Year Experience from Industries of the Future Research Experience for Preservice Teacher in STEM Settings;"Zhu W.; Greer T.W.; Evans P.; Lei F.; Benhaddou D.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In 2023, University of Houston (UH) in Houston, Texas was awarded an NSF Research Experience for Preservice Teachers (RE-PST) site grant titled “Industries of the Future Research Experience for Preservice Teachers in STEM Settings.” The goal of the project is to host 10 high school preservice teachers each summer to participate in Industries of the Future (IotF) research fields and then convert their experience into high school curriculum. In the 2020 Report of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) to the President of the USA, PCAST has recommended a set of bold actions to help ensure continued leadership in IotF, comprising artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), advanced manufacturing, advanced communications, and biotechnology. In summer 2023, the first cohort of 8 preservice teachers (PST) from the UH teachHOUSTON (tH) PST program participated in the RE-PST program at UH Cullen College of Engineering (CCOE). This six-week program, open to high school STEM PSTs in the tH program, sought to advance future educators' knowledge of concepts in IotF as a means of enriching high school curriculums defined in the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standard. Six UH CCOE professors each led workshops in a week. Five research mentors, assisted by student research assistants, mentored PSTs on various projects. The group also participated in field trips to local companies including Samson Controls, TechnipFMC, Beckhoff Automation, and SLB (Schlumberger). They worked with the professors in the teachHOUSTON on applying their knowledge learned to lesson plan design. Participants met weekly for Brown Bag teacher seminars to share their experiences and discuss curricula. On the final day of the program, the PSTs presented their curriculum prototype for their future field teaching to the group and received completion certificates. This summer is special in that this cohort of 8 PSTs participated in some activities together with 15 high school in-service teachers in the Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at UH. The common activities include one day workshop in SolidWorks design, field trips, and some curriculum development sessions. Two research mentors mentored both PST and in-service teachers. PST participants found the research experience with their mentors beneficial not only to them, but also to their future students according to our findings from interviews. Selected course modules will be submitted to teachengineering.org for other K-12 educators to access. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.
Comparing Student Preferences for AI-Generated and Peer-Generated Feedback in AI-driven Formative Peer Assessment;"Shin I.; Hwang S.B.; Yoo Y.J.; Bae S.; Kim R.Y.";2025;15th  International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2025;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3706468.3706488;;;Yes;;Formative assessment can enhance student learning and improve teaching practices by identifying areas for growth and providing feedback. However, practical obstacles remain, such as time constraints and students' passive participation and the low quality of peer feedback. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored for its potential to automate grading and provide timely feedback, making it a valuable tool in formative assessment. Nevertheless, there is still limited research on how AI can be used effectively in the context of formative peer assessment. In this study, we conducted an AI-driven formative peer assessment with 108 secondary school students. During the peer assessment process, students not only evaluated peers' responses and received peer-generated feedback, but also evaluated AI-generated responses and received AI-generated feedback. This research focused on analyzing the differences in preference between AI-generated and peer-generated feedback using trace data and dispositional data. In scenarios where student participation was low or the quality of peer feedback was insufficient, students showed a higher preference for AI-generated feedback, demonstrating its potential utility. However, students with high Math Confidence and AI Interest preferred peer-generated feedback. Based on these findings, we will propose practical strategies for implementing AI-driven formative peer assessment. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The first purpose of this paper is to discuss the possibility of approaching elementary game theory in high schools. The second objective is to analyze the students’ response in terms of learning, but also of liking. Is it possible “giocare con la teoria dei giochi” (Engl. transl: play with game theory) in the classroom? The third objective is to highlight the possible links between elementary game theory and the grossone-based system introduced by Y.D. Sergeyev. Once again with the didactic aspect of providing high school students with an “easy” and stimulating approach to modern research fields in mathematics. In particular, we describe the approach to a little cycle of lessons of two classes and the performances of a conclusive students’ class test. We will see a great students response, above all regarding the connection between game theory and the grossone system. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.
Investigating the Impact of the AI-Supported 5E (AI-s5E) Instructional Model on Spatial Ability;"Gürefe N.; Sarpkaya Akta? G.; Öksüz H.";2024;Behavioral Sciences;Article;Scopus;10.3390/bs14080682;;;Yes;Yes;Improving students’ spatial abilities is an important goal in education. Spatial ability is a skill needed in many fields, such as science, mathematics, engineering, and architecture. Since this ability can be improved through training, this study adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of an artificial intelligence-supported 5E (AI-s5E) instructional model on students’ spatial visualization, spatial relationships, and spatial orientation performances that explain their spatial abilities. A total of 43 students from two classes at a secondary school in western Turkey were recruited to participate in this study. One of the classes was the experimental group (f = 23), which adopted the AI-s5E approach, and the other class was the control group (f = 20), which adopted the traditional teaching model. The results showed that the integration of the AI-s5E instructional approach into education improved students’ spatial abilities and sub-dimensions. In light of the findings, it can be recommended that AI applications, which have a positive and significant impact on spatial skills, can be integrated into teachers’ lessons and even included in curriculum programs. © 2024 by the authors.
Visualization in Blended Learning of Geometry in the High School;"Manyakhina V.; Makarova P.; Smirnova I.";2025;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-84039-5_4;;;Yes;;During the COVID-19 pandemic, many teachers reconsidered their attitudes to-ward online learning. According to surveys, they will combine online educational materials and face-to-face classroom practices. Blended learning in mathematics education provides personalized learning, alternative methods for teacher-student feedback and communication. In addition, mathematics teachers get the opportunity to make extensive use of 3D graphics technologies, AR applications, dynamic geometry environments for visualization. Our goal is an empirical study of the conditions for improving the effectiveness of teaching stereometry in high school through the use of visualization technologies and blended learning. Our re-search confirmed that after forced distance learning in the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a positive change in the attitude of math teachers towards blended learning, and that high school students are ready for blended learning. A blended learning model for geometry was proposed, a feature of which is that the content of the digital learning environment is based on the principles of visualization, and e-tools for visualization are actively used in teaching. The conducted research proved the success of the proposed model. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.
Moroccan Teachers’ Perceptions About Integrating Historical Contexts and AI in the Seamless Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics;Daoudi M.;2025;African Journal of Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education;Article;Scopus;10.1080/18117295.2025.2460911;;;Yes;;This article critically examines deficiencies in the final year high school programme, particularly in the Physics–Chemistry and Mathematics A and B specialties, focusing on the inadequate transition from classical to quantum mechanics. Based on teachers’ perceptions, the study analyses the value of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and historical science narratives to address the complex relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The analysis reveals a disjointed narrative hindering students’ understanding during the critical transition phase, emphasising the insufficiency of a single lesson, ‘Atom and Newton’s Mechanics’ at the academic year’s end. The proposed comprehensive methodology for curriculum revision aims to seamlessly integrate historical narratives into the educational framework, providing a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness between classical and quantum mechanics. The discussion emphasises the potential positive impacts on student engagement, comprehension and enthusiasm for physics, extending beyond content adjustments to transform pedagogical strategies. The conclusion highlights the broader significance of these changes for science education, suggesting a curriculum overhaul informed by historical narratives and AI integration could shape a generation of scientifically literate individuals, adept at navigating contemporary physics complexities. The article serves as a call to action for teachers, curriculum developers and policymakers to innovate high school science education in line with the dynamic nature of scientific discovery. © 2025 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).
Immersive learning tools for teaching mathematics to high school students in general secondary education institutions;"Lytvynova S.; Rashevska N.";2025;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"For the dynamic and sustainable development of an individual throughout life, the ability to shape a personal learning trajectory, communicate and collaborate in a team, prioritize life goals, and achieve them becomes a key aspect. Forming this kind of personality is one of the objectives of general secondary education institutions. Creating an educational environment that allows every student to realize their potential is impossible without innovative technologies, among which immersive technologies stand out as some of the most progressive. The use of immersive technologies in the educational process for high school students makes this process dynamic and engaging due to the interactivity of such technologies and their high level of visual representation. In Ukraine’s secondary education system, the practice of implementing immersive technologies has demonstrated their effectiveness by increasing motivation to learn, which, in turn, has led to better academic performance. This study focuses on the use of immersive technologies in the teaching of mathematics to high school students in general secondary education institutions. Scientific literature highlights four main topics regarding the use of immersive technologies in education: 1) the impact of immersive technologies on learning outcomes; 2) the use of immersive technologies for learning and simulation; 3) the influence of immersive technologies on interaction and user engagement; 4) ethical and social implications of immersive technologies. In Ukrainian secondary education institutions, platforms for immersive learning include developments from both Ukraine and other countries. These platforms, such as AR Book, mozaBook, GeoGebra, and Desmos, are user-friendly, require no software installation, allow interaction with educational materials, and include both pre-designed tasks and the ability for students to create their own projects. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors."

For middle and high school students, data science can put formerly decontextualized subjects into real-world scenarios. Many existing curricula, however, lack authenticity and personal relevance for students. A critique of data science courseware cites the lack of ""author proximity,""in which students do not contribute to the data's production or see their personal experiences reflected in the data. This paper introduces a novel data science curriculum to scaffold middle and high school students in undertaking real-world data science practices. Through project-based learning modules, the curriculum engages students in investigating solutions to community-based problems through visualization and analysis of live sensor data and public data sets. Materials include formative assessments to help educators (especially those from non-math and computing backgrounds) measure their students' abilities to identify statistical patterns, critically evaluate data biases, and make predictions. As we pilot and co-design with teachers, we will look closely at whether the curriculum's resources can successfully support non-technical practitioners engaging in an integrated curriculum. © 2024 Owner/Author."
Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the growing actor in education: Raising critical consciousness towards power and ethics of AI in K-12 STEM classrooms;"Akgün S.; Krajcik J.";2024;Uses of Artificial Intelligence in STEM Education;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1093/oso/9780198882077.003.0022;;;Yes;;"Artificial intelligence (AI) incorporates the applications of machine-learning systems dominantly within the automated assessment and intelligent tutoring systems.

Applying Machine Learning and SHAP Method to Identify Key Influences on Middle-School Students’ Mathematics Literacy Performance;"Huang Y.; Zhou Y.; Chen J.; Wu D.";2024;Journal of Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.3390/jintelligence12100093;;;Yes;;The PISA 2022 literacy assessment highlights a significant decline in math performance among most OECD countries, with the magnitude of this decline being approximately three times that of the previous round. Remarkably, Hong Kong, Macao, Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea ranked in the top six among all participating countries or economies, with Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea also demonstrating improved performance. Given the widespread concern about the factors influencing secondary-school students’ mathematical literacy, this paper adopts machine learning and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to analyze 34,968 samples and 151 features from six East Asian education systems within the PISA 2022 dataset, aiming to pinpoint the crucial factors that affect middle-school students’ mathematical literacy. First, the XGBoost model has the highest prediction accuracy for math literacy performance. Second, 15 variables were identified as significant predictors of mathematical literacy across the student population, particularly variables such as mathematics self-efficacy (MATHEFF) and expected occupational status (BSMJ). Third, mathematics self-efficacy was determined to be the most influential factor. Fourth, the factors influencing mathematical literacy vary among individual students, including the key influencing factors, the direction (positive or negative) of their impact, and the extent of this influence. Finally, based on our findings, four recommendations are proffered to enhance the mathematical literacy performance of secondary-school students. © 2024 by the authors.
Automated feedback improves teachers’ questioning quality in brick-and-mortar classrooms: Opportunities for further enhancement;"Demszky D.; Liu J.; Hill H.C.; Sanghi S.; Chung A.";2025;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105183;;;Yes;;AI-powered professional learning tools that provide teachers with individualized feedback on their instruction have proven effective at improving instruction and student engagement in virtual learning contexts. Despite the need for consistent, personalized professional learning in K-12 settings, the effectiveness of automated feedback tools in traditional classrooms remains unexplored. We present results from 224 Utah mathematics and science teachers who engaged in a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, conducted in partnership with TeachFX, to assess the impact of automated feedback in K-12 classrooms. This feedback targeted “focusing questions” — questions that probe students’ thinking by pressing for explanations and reflection. We find that teachers opened emails containing the automated feedback about 53–65% of the time, and the feedback increased their use of focusing questions by 20% (p < 0.01) compared to the control group. The feedback did not impact other teaching practices. Qualitative interviews with 13 teachers revealed mixed perceptions of the automated feedback. Some teachers appreciated the reflective insights, while others faced barriers such as skepticism about accuracy, data privacy concerns, and time constraints. Our findings highlight the promises and areas of improvement for implementing effective and teacher-friendly automated professional learning tools in brick-and-mortar classrooms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

The advent of AI technology has made comprehensive and in-depth teaching evaluation possible, serving as a significant driving force for efficient and precise teaching. There were few empirical studies on the application of high-quality precision teaching models in the field of compulsory education, and the learning difficulty of technology and the teaching burden on teachers have become significant factors hindering the use of technology to support education. This study analyzed teaching models from the perspectives of teachers’ teaching burdens and students’ learning obstacles, and was committed to relying on intelligent technology to construct a new precision teaching model, an educational diagnosis–feedback–intervention path that covered the entire teaching process, from the dimensions of teacher behavior, student behavior, and parent behavior, aiming to assist teachers in efficient teaching and students in personalized learning. This study was conducted with nine science classes, including about 540 people in the second year of high school at a Middle School in China; six classes were the intervention groups while the last three classes were control groups, and a survey of 19 teachers from the intervention classes was carried out. The results showed that this model can significantly improve students’ academic performance in science subjects, especially in mathematics and chemistry. It has increased the proportion of high-achieving students, reduced the proportion of low-achieving students, stimulated students’ self-directed learning ability, cultivated a positive attitude towards science learning, and explained the key points of using a precision teaching model in different disciplines. It has achieved a deep integration of education and technology, helping to increase the efficiency and reduce the burden of teaching. © 2024 by the authors."
Designing a Series of Activities to Expose High School Students to Manufacturing;"Kuleshov Y.A.; Lucietto A.M.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;High schools across the United States expose students to various types of engineering curriculum, including activities of different duration and content. The duration varies from 30 min to a class-long and beyond, going into a series of class meetings to finish an activity. A lot of content is focused on the school subject topics. Some of those subjects, like mathematics, physics, and chemistry are present in both high school and college. Others, like some types of engineering, have no direct link to the school subjects. One example is manufacturing engineering and manufacturing engineering technology. When students are unaware of the manufacturing possibilities, they end up selecting the different career paths, which is the negative scenario for the United States domestic manufacturing efforts. The authors designed a series of high school activities that would introduce students to the topics of Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 (I4.0). The goals of the activities are to a) raise student awareness and stimulate interest in the topics and b) inspire students to pursue a degree in a new manufacturing-related college major at a Midwestern university. The authors collected information on the existing activities from different sources, such as the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) website, different professional education websites of the top engineering universities in the United States, and others. The authors worked with the leadership from the Midwestern university's academia-industry collaboration center and select manufacturing industry stakeholders to retrieve additional activities. The content of the activities can provide students with the knowledge and skills that are essential for them to have in the 21st century economy. The designed activities can be useful for both the practitioners in the field and higher education institutions, who seek to inspire and recruit future talents to underrepresented fields like manufacturing. The structure of the designed activities can be used to design additional activities and align them with appropriate I4.0 competencies. The potential deployment of the activities in high school classrooms will help meet the United States strategic goal of supporting domestic manufacturing efforts and raising its competitiveness on the world market. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.

AI-Driven Educational Transformation in Secondary Schools: Leveraging Data Insights for Inclusive Learning Environments;"Duraes D.; Bezerra R.; Novais P.";2024;IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578910;;Yes;Yes;;In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a progressive trend towards teaching that is more personalised to students' characteristics and some models of prediction failure that are more accurate. In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students. The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands. Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments. In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.  © 2024 IEEE.
Using Prompt Engineering to Enhance STEM Education;Li M.Z.;2024;2024 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2024;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664775;;;Yes;;With the advent of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini and LLaMA, there is no doubt that AI will forever change how education works. However, there is a gap between K-12 students and the LLM. The prompts given to LLM need to be well designed to be effectively utilized for K-12 education. To use LLMs more appropriately for K-12 STEM educational purposes, the author developed a prototype tool with prompt engineering to fully utilize the educational potential of LLMs and reduce usage for academic dishonesty. The tool would have a student register by giving the grade that they're in, and then ask as the topic the student would like to learn more about. Using prompt engineering techniques, the tool can prompt LLMs to produce educational content such as a descriptions, question and answer, AI-generated quizzes, and reviews, as well as asking the LLM to simplifying complex topics further to aid in understanding. The AI-enabled tool, effectively a virtual and personal mentor, could help propel STEM education further and make STEM more interesting to students as it could help explain complex topics in a way that students can understand easily. The tool and AI can help students understand a topic through interactive practice instead of just memorizing facts and putting them on a sheet of paper. The tool present in this paper will enhance the STEP education by AI. © 2024 IEEE.
Exploring the Impact of Systems Engineering Projects on STEM Engagement and Learning;"Tonkal M.; Wu A.; Rogers C.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893437;;;Yes;;Systems engineering is the interdisciplinary process of managing and executing complex engineering projects. As K-12 education increasingly emphasizes STEM education and engagement, our project-based systems engineering curriculum aims to add to the existing body of effective instructional approaches for stronger collaboration, problem-solving, and engineering skills in students. We designed and tested our curriculum at Acera, an independent Massachusetts school for science, creativity, and leadership. Elementary school students at a four-day Acera camp participated in our systems engineering project: building a smart model of a LEGO city. Split into teams, students earned badges for developing skills such as Python coding, and Robotics as they ventured to build a school and a town hall, a transportation system, and even a renewable energy source. Our field observations and interviews revealed patterns of motivation and applications of systems thinking in our students. We found that gamification, badges, and earnable points both engaged and united students by rewarding growth in STEM skills and setting achievable, tangible, class-wide goals. Students encountered problems head-on, working on faulty code or missing railroad pieces without direction from an adult, demonstrating our project's facilitation of implicit motivation. Students also communicated across teams by suggesting new tasks, which was rewarded with class-wide points, or adjusting their own work based on the results of another team, demonstrating an adoption of systems thinking. All of their efforts culminated into a city of many moving parts-motorized trains, color-sensor cars, windmills, and conveyor belts. Each part was made by a different team, so each team had to collaborate across disciplines to create the LEGO city. © 2024 IEEE.

Learning Programming with VEX Robotics: Influence on Student Motivation in International Secondary School from Teachers' Perspective;"Choi I.-C.; Choi W.-C.; Huang B.; Mendes A.J.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893583;;;Yes;;This Research Full paper explores teachers' perceptions of how VEX robotics programming courses influence secondary education students' programming learning motivation. Educational robotics is increasingly recognized as an effective teaching tool for enhancing students' interest in and proficiency in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). VEX Robotics is one of the most well-known, practical learning tools that allow students to showcase their programming abilities and creativity. However, little research has been done on how VEX robotics impact teaching practices and students' learning motivation from teachers' perspectives. While VEX robotics is widely utilized in educational environments for teaching robotics and programming concepts, more detailed research is needed to understand how its implementation influences student learning motivation, and overall teaching effectiveness. This study was conducted by interviewing teachers, who were experienced in using VEX in this pedagogical context at an international secondary school in Macao. In particular, the study focused on teachers' opinions about the impact of VEX robotics on students' learning motivation. Qualitative data was obtained through semi-structured interviews with robotic teachers, providing deeper insights into students' motivation and participation in the robotics environment. The study employed the ARCS model as a theoretical framework. The teachers' interview outputs were examined considering the model's four dimensions: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The findings highlighted that teachers valued the use of VEX robotics and believed that it increased students' motivation in all the dimensions of the ARCS model. © 2024 IEEE.

Can Generative AI Solve Geometry Problems? Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs for Geometric Reasoning in Spanish;"Parra V.; Sureda P.; Corica A.; Schiaffino S.; Godoy D.";2024;International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.9781/ijimai.2024.02.009;;;Yes;;Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive technology that is challenging traditional teaching and learning practices. Question-answering in natural language fosters the use of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard and others, that generate text based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The performance of these models in certain areas, like Math problem solving is receiving a crescent attention as it directly impacts on its potential use in educational settings. Most of these evaluations, however, concentrate on the construction and use of benchmarks comprising diverse Math problems in English. In this work, we discuss the capabilities of most used LLMs within the subfield of Geometry, in view of the relevance of this subject in high-school curricula and the difficulties exhibited by even most advanced multimodal LLMs to deal with geometric notions. This work focuses on Spanish, which is additionally a less resourced language. The answers of three major chatbots, based on different LLMs, were analyzed not only to determine their capacity to provide correct solutions, but also to categorize the errors found in the reasoning processes described. Understanding LLMs strengths and weaknesses in a field like Geometry can be a first step towards the design of more informed methodological proposals to include these technologies in classrooms as well as the development of more powerful automatic assistance tools based on generative AI. © 2024, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Design and Implementation of an Educational Game for Teaching Artificial Intelligence to High School Students;"Wang N.; Montgomery R.; Greenwald E.; Leitner M.";2023;31st International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2023 - Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Artificial intelligence (Al) is becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. In more and more fields, Al systems are transforming how knowledge is constructed, discoveries are realized, and how solutions are developed and tested. These changes have profound implications for the future workforce and citizenry. Yet, learning Al remains a niche subject largely reserved for advanced post-secondary educational contexts. While there is growing attention to broadening Al educational opportunities and, especially, to providing learning experiences for younger students, relatively little is currently known about how to most effectively provide Al education to K-12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) students. In this paper, we discuss the design and present findings from an implementation study of an educational game for high-school Al education called ARIN-561. Drawing on an integrated analysis of gameplay log data, pre/post knowledge, and disposition surveys for nearly 1.000 high school students, we present findings on the efficacy of the educational game and its constituent activities in advancing Al learning goals. We explore possible interactions between learning outcomes, incoming math knowledge, prior gaming experience, and other factors that can inform future learning design and shed light on what can position youth for success in game-based Al learning experiences. © 2023 Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.

A Study on the Impact of Using 6E Model combined with the Self-efficacy Strategies for An AIoT Hands-on Activity to Students'STEM Career Interest, Learning Effectiveness and Behavior Pattern;"Tsao J.D.; Tsao Y.C.";2023;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3625704.3625710;;;Yes;;With the arrival of the era of Industry 4.0, the development of technologies such as Internet of Things and others has gradually been implemented in daily life. The Artificial Internet of Things can be used for STEM teaching. Its integrates the comprehensive knowledge and application of technology in the fields of science, machinery, mathematics, information and artificial intelligence.The middle school stage is a critical period for young people to develop STEM career interests, especially for the high school students. Not only they should experience an important exploratory process of choosing a department at the university but also they need to cultivate their career interest and career decision-making abilities for career preparation. However, there are few opportunities for students to actively explore their interests and integrate practical skills and hence most high school students have a huge cognitive gap between their interests in future career and their background knowledge. Therefore, this research uses the 6E model combined with the self-efficacy strategies in order to enable students to participate more actively in class discussions and complete their practical works with the help of their peers, thereby accumulating a sense of accomplishment and gaining better learning performance. According to the results, we can find that there are significant differences in STEM career interest, IoT knowledge and hands-on ability. Besides, it also shows that students in the 6E model combined with the self-efficacy strategies group can have good STEM career interest and learning effectiveness, which can help them in the development of related STEM careers in the future. © 2023 ACM.
Integrating Space Education into STEAM;Valiyeva G.;2024;Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC;Conference paper;Scopus;10.52202/078378-0140;;;Yes;;"STEAM courses are becoming a major concern in education systems. Researches indicates that students who participate in space education programs become more interested in science, technology, engineering, art and math (STEAM) fields. Many of these space education initiatives are informal. Space education gives students the opportunity to study multiple disciplines, enabling them to acquire critical skills. This abstract suggests a method for including space education in formal education systems to incorporate transdisciplinary STEAM subjects. It offers a summary of space education and recommends a number of original space education exercises that might be incorporated into formal education programs. The term STEAM is frequently used to refer to simply one of the subjects that it encompasses, most frequently science. Even while an increasing number of studies are promoting the integration of STEAM fields, few of them deal with several fields, and the ones that offer conflicting results and insufficient guidance for furthering STEAM research. Prior research indicates that applying knowledge and abilities from multiple disciplines to real-world challenges and projects might enhance the overall learning experience. This requirement is met by space education, which combines a multidisciplinary approach with real-world application. Therefore, it is proposed that space education be included in the formal framework within the context of disciplinary integration, transdisciplinary learning, and the application of theory. Earlier research describes a range of informal space education programs (SEPs) provided globally by space agencies. According to assessments of these non-formal learning initiatives, space education through these programs can pique kids’ interest and inspire them to enrol in classes and subsequently seek jobs in engineering, science, or technology. Though informal SEPs have proven beneficial, space education has not yet been widely incorporated into formal education curriculum. This abstract defines a SEP as the formal instruction, training, and incorporation of space-related topics within science and technology curricula. The following cognitive abilities are referred to as STEAM skills: critical thinking, scientific literacy, digital literacy, mathematical literacy, and creative thinking. The research findings presented in this paper will be utilized to develop a SEP teaching model that can be incorporated into science and technology curricula for middle schools. The purpose of the study is to investigate how SEP affects middle school students’ cognitive skill acquisition; analyse how SEP has affected middle school pupils’ understanding of science and technology; analyse the general perspectives of students regarding science and technology; create a SEP program that can be incorporated into high school science and technology curricula.

Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are topics of great importance and interest but are often reserved for higher-level education. Introductions of complex subjects in high school promotes student efficacy, enthusiasm, and skill-development for STEM careers. Establishing strong partnerships between universities and high schools is mutually beneficial for the professional development of students, teachers, and professors. In this paper, we detail immersive outreach efforts and their effectiveness in a high school setting. Methods: From Spring 2021 to Spring 2024, we conducted eight data-science and analysis-coding style workshops along with two data science units, with 302 students participating in the data science workshops and 82 students in the data science units. All students who participated in the data science lessons completed a comprehensive final project. Surveys measuring knowledge and appeal to data science and coding were conducted both retrospectively and prospectively, before and after each workshop and the data science units. A 1 year follow up survey was conducted for students in the 2023 data science lessons (n = 23). Results: Overall, average student interest significantly increased from 2.72 ± 1.08/5.0 (n = 205) to 3.15 ± 1.18/5.0 (n = 181, p = 0.001) during the data science workshops, while 70% of students expressed desire to continue with coding. Interest modestly increased in the data science lessons from 3.15 ± 0.65/4.0 to 3.17 ± 0.77/4.0 (n = 82, p = 0.8571), while knowledge significantly increased from 64.16% to 88.5% (% correct out of six questions) in the 2023 data science lessons and from 52.62% to 60.79% (% correct out of 29 questions) in the 2024 data science lessons. Discussion: Increasing STEM exposure through outreach programs and a modified curriculum can positively alter students’ career trajectory and prepare them for the evolving technologically advanced world and the careers within it.

Creating Learning Communities for Student Success in Gateway Discrete Linear Systems;Schrader C.B.;2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"Wright State University is a multi-campus, public research university headquartered in Dayton, Ohio, which has one of the largest concentrations of electrical engineers and computer scientists in the United States [1]. By the early twentieth century this region was well-known as a center for innovation and entrepreneurship, becoming the top site in the country in patents per capita in 1903 when the university's namesakes Orville and Wilbur Wright flew. Wright State University was created in 1967 to meet the region's needs for research, innovation and education and is situated on land that formerly belonged to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), home of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and five directorates. Technology companies surround the university and base, creating a vibrant innovation hub. To this day, electrical engineering continues to play a large role in the workforce and in opportunity afforded the citizenry, university and prospective and current students of all ages. In a proactive move to provide students more flexibility, electrical engineering faculty members at Wright State University conducted an in-depth review of all course pre-requisites to streamline the Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) program and make it more adaptable for students with diverse experiences to progress through their degrees. This includes high school students accessing university curricula through the state's dual enrollment opportunities; a technology workforce heavy in job opportunities, internships and co-ops for those with degrees and interest in electrical engineering at all levels; a large influx of active and retired military and civilians; and an accessible and affordable research university in the heart of it all. Among others, changes in pre-requisites occurred in both Continuous Linear Systems and Discrete Linear Systems, which had previously been offered respectively in sequence and had required higher-level mathematics. These gateway courses were both reorganized with the same pre-requisites effective Summer 2022 - Analog Circuit Theory with accompanying laboratory and Calculus II - without any particular ordering of linear systems courses; that is, students may take continuous first, discrete first, or both courses simultaneously. This flexibility recognizes that diverse student experiences may enhance student success dependent upon the first course passed. Of note, Analog Circuit Theory now includes electrical quantities and their relationships, transform-calculus impedance models, conservation models leveraging algebraic solutions, transform-calculus-derived algebraic models of dynamic systems, and mathematical solution techniques. Calculus II remains fairly standard and includes integration techniques, applications of the definite integral, numeral integration and improper integrals, parametric equations and polar coordinates, and infinite sequences and series. The author taught both linear systems courses in addition to follow-on control courses before and after these pre-requisite changes were implemented and was successful in transitioning learning achievement to the new pre-requisite scenario. Both courses are gateway, required courses for the BSEE, often are first courses in the major that challenge students theoretically, and either or both may become a barrier to success; as such, they have higher rates of students earning a D or an F or withdrawing from the class with a W (i.e., DFW rates). Many required courses and technical electives in the junior and senior years dictate proficiency in foundational linear systems topics. For these reasons and at the author's recommendation, the Wright State University College of Engineering and Computer Science (CECS) Undergraduate Policy and Curriculum Committee selected these two linear systems courses to include in a year-long, university-wide initiative to improve student success. Although originally designed for online/hybrid implementation, many of the innovative strategies on creating learning communities Reported here port seamlessly to in-person classes and benefit students regardless of content or modality. Such ideas were implemented in the author's Summer 2023 online/hybrid course and Fall 2023 in-person/hybrid offering of Discrete Linear Systems with promising results. The section following provides additional motivation and novel strategies demonstrated to be particularly attuned with the current generation of students effected by COVID-19 and other disruptions in learning. With flexibility at the forefront, important factors to student success and skills gaps are addressed. Specific course enhancements and results then are highlighted and conclusions described. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."

Aligning AIED Systems to Embodied Cognition and Learning Theories;"Arroyo I.; Rasul I.; Crabtree D.; Castro F.; Poh A.; Gattupalli S.; Lee W.; Smith H.; Micciolo M.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_1;; ;Yes;;"Embodied Learning involves the development of perceptuo-motor schemas as students manipulate physical objects that embody a concept, or when students move in domain-relevant ways, physically enacting solutions to problems, as well as gesturing as they interact with peers face-to-face. Teaching standards (e.g., for K-12 math education) align with such theories of learning. For instance, teachers are encouraged to have students “talk mathematics”, construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, model with mathematics, and use tools with precision, among others. Yet most learning technologies and tutoring systems are not designed to facilitate embodied learning; instead, they tend to align with more traditional views of student learning. This paper explores possible ways AIED systems can reflect embodied learning theories, within K-12 STEM education. We present the WearableLearning platform as an example that intends to bring embodied learning to mathematics and computing education for students at the K-12 level, with implications and suggestions on how to use Artificial Intelligence to make embodied learning environments more effective. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."
A MOOC for exam training mathematics using intelligent tutoring;"Rothkrantz C.; Fitrianie S.; Rothkrantz L.";2024;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;Conference;Scopus;10.1145/3674912.3674928;;;Yes;;Many high school students require costly private lessons to prepare for their final exams. These lessons go beyond what regular schools can provide. As a proof of concept, a distance learning program for exam preparation has been created using Moodle. It offers study materials that incorporate gaming and real-life applications. Each lesson begins with a diagnostic test and follows a specific training program to address students' weaknesses. An AI-based intelligent tutoring system has been developed to take on the role of a teacher and assist students with their work. After the system analyzes errors, the tutor provides specific hints and guidelines to help students solve problems accurately. The developed study material was tested on a group of students preparing for their final exams in mathematics.  © 2024 Owner/Author.
ChatGPT, Finances, and Degree Attainment: Increasing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Utilization and Implications for Students' Decision-Making;Fletcher T.;2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892857;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Students' decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic. Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools. Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#l) is: What is the top reason why students do notfinish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation. This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes.

Learning Factors for TIMSS Math Performance Evidenced Through Machine Learning in the UAE;"Nadaf A.; Monroe S.; Chandran S.; Miao X.";2023;Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1007/978-981-19-8040-4_4;;;Yes;;Understanding how the UAE K12 education system performs with data-driven evidence is key to inform better policy making to support UAE vision to upskill human capital growth for its economic transformation. In this study, we investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques to understand key learning factors contributing to UAE student math performance on the TIMSS 2019 assessment. Due to the fact that learning factors co-exist and interact with one another, we explore the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the complexity of the model. The results highlight the importance and contributions of each learning factor and uncover the relationships between the learning factors. Understanding key learning factors and identifying evidence-based intervention opportunities will help policymakers with informed education intervention designs to improve student mathematics learning, in order to improve UAE student TIMSS math performance over the long run. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

Using Machine Learning Methods to Develop Person-Centered Models Predicting STEM Major Choice;"Nagy M.; Main J.B.; Molontay R.; Griffith A.L.";2023;SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.21427/EE90-XX67;;;Yes;;Understanding the factors that influence the choice of a STEM major is important for developing effective strategies to increase participation in STEM fields and meet the growing demand for skilled workers. This research is based on the nationally representative data of 25,206 students surveyed in the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). The HSLS:09 includes longitudinal data from 9th-grade students through their postsecondary study. First, we use machine learning to predict who is going to opt for a STEM major. Then we use interpretable ML tools, such as SHAP values, to investigate the key factors that influence students' decisions to pursue a college STEM major. We identified with a relatively high degree of accuracy the students who will later choose a STEM major, namely our CatBoost classifier achieved an AUC score of 0.791. Moreover, by interpreting the model, we find that having a science or math identity, as well as demographic characteristics, such as gender and race, play important roles in the decision to pursue a STEM major. For example, Asians are more, females are less likely to consider a STEM major, on the other hand, we also find that gender and race do not influence students' science or math identity. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Effectiveness of tutoring at school: A machine learning evaluation;"Ballestar M.T.; Mir M.C.; Pedrera L.M.D.; Sainz J.";2024;Technological Forecasting and Social Change;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123043;;;Yes;Yes;Tutoring programs are effective in reducing school failures among at-risk students. However, there is still room for improvement in maximising the social returns they provide on investments. Many factors and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on providing public administration with advanced decision-making tools. First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of the Programa para la Mejora de Éxito Educativo (Programme for the Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla y Léon in Spain, in 2018–2019, the academic year previous to the pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO). Second, we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and explained how different factors and components affect student engagement and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol. © 2023 The Author(s)
A case study of using AI for General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) grade prediction in a selective independent school in England;Denes G.;2023;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100129;;;Yes;;The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for UK schools, but a time of cancelled exams and uncertainty around future examinations can provide opportunities to explore novel assessment methods. Hence, the 2020 proposal of the Ofqual algorithm which combines teachers' estimated grades and schools' historical performance seemed timely. However, the algorithmically calculated grades resulted in a public backlash and withdrawal of the proposal. While the failed Ofqual algorithm could be considered an example of AI, we do not yet have a thorough understanding of its numerical accuracy and how it performs in comparison to other AI models. This paper investigates this novel application: the potential use of a range of AI models as assessment tools in a selective, independent, secondary school in England. The following questions were examined: (1) how accurate are modern AI models in predicting GCSE exam grades? (2) what are the differences in model accuracy across subjects and can these be explained by qualitative differences in teachers' grading practices? Results indicate that while models yield acceptable mean absolute errors, individual mispredictions can be larger than desired. Subject differences highlighted that grading subjectivity is less significant in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects, which could explain why objective models fail to predict non-STEM grades more frequently. In summary, numerical results indicate that grade prediction could be an interesting novel application of AI, but more research is needed to reduce outliers. © 2023 The Author(s)
STEM Play & Learn: A Summer Family Learning Programme in Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Communities;"Alcala A.; Bleach J.; O'Neill J.; Kane T.; Hennessy-Mccann E.; Booth J.; Darmody K.; Pathak P.; Stynes P.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893101;;;Yes;;This innovative practice full paper describes a home-based summer family learning programme, STEM Play & Learn, designed to support kindergarten-aged children and their families by engaging them in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) activities. 'Summer Learning Loss' is the phenomenon where children experience a decrease in academic knowledge and skills when they take an extended break from education, particularly during the summer holidays. Children from lower socio-economic status backgrounds are disproportionately affected by summer learning loss. This research investigates the efficacy of a novel STEM Summer Family Learning Programme for 4-6-year-old children in a socio-economically disadvantaged community. The novelty of our programme centres around the practice and pedagogy delivered in the child's home with parental engagement at its core. The programme is delivered once a week over six weeks by Home Visitors. Child-directed open-ended play-based STEM activities are modelled to encourage children to develop higher-order thinking skills. Parents and children are encouraged to explore these educational STEM Play and Learn activities further between visits. Through a community action research methodology, this research employs a cyclical process of observing, reflecting, acting, evaluating, and modifying. Results of parent and child evaluation data show promise in improving the children's developmental skills and positively influencing the home learning environment. Results also indicate there was an increase in the parents' confidence in teaching their children STEM at home. The findings contribute insights into how an innovative STEM family learning programme for early years educators and parents enhances educational outcomes for kindergarten-aged children and mitigates summer learning loss. © 2024 IEEE.
A Holistic Approach to Use Educational Robots for Supporting Computer Science Courses;"Mamatnabiyev Z.; Chronis C.; Varlamis I.; Himeur Y.; Zhaparov M.";2024;Computers;Article;Scopus;10.3390/computers13040102;;;Yes;Yes;Robots are intelligent machines that are capable of autonomously performing intricate sequences of actions, with their functionality being primarily driven by computer programs and machine learning models. Educational robots are specifically designed and used for teaching and learning purposes and attain the interest of learners in gaining knowledge about science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Educational robots are widely applied in different fields of primary and secondary education, but their usage in teaching higher education subjects is limited. Even when educational robots are used in tertiary education, the use is sporadic, targets specific courses or subjects, and employs robots with narrow applicability. In this work, we propose a holistic approach to the use of educational robots in tertiary education. We demonstrate how an open source educational robot can be used by colleges, and universities in teaching multiple courses of a computer science curriculum, fostering computational and creative thinking in practice. We rely on an open-source and open design educational robot, called FOSSBot, which contains various IoT technologies for measuring data, processing it, and interacting with the physical world. Grace to its open nature, FOSSBot can be used in preparing the content and supporting learning activities for different subjects such as electronics, computer networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, etc. To support our claim, we describe a computer science curriculum containing a wide range of computer science courses and explain how each course can be supported by providing indicative activities. The proposed one-year curriculum can be delivered at the postgraduate level, allowing computer science graduates to delve deep into Computer Science subjects. After examining related works that propose the use of robots in academic curricula we detect the gap that still exists for a curriculum that is linked to an educational robot and we present in detail each proposed course, the software libraries that can be employed for each course and the possible extensions to the open robot that will allow to further extend the curriculum with more topics or enhance it with activities. With our work, we show that by incorporating educational robots in higher education we can address this gap and provide a new ledger for boosting tertiary education. © 2024 by the authors.

Applying STEM and extended reality technologies to explore students' artificial intelligence learning performance and behavior for sustainable development goals;"Su Y.-S.; Tseng W.-L.; Cheng H.-W.; Lai C.-F.";2024;Library Hi Tech;Article;Scopus;10.1108/LHT-08-2023-0362;;;Yes;;Purpose: To support achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), we integrated science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and extended reality technologies into an artificial intelligence (AI) learning activity. We developed Feature City to facilitate students' learning of AI concepts. This study aimed to explore students' learning outcomes and behaviors when using Feature City. Design/methodology/approach: Junior high school students were the subjects who used Feature City in an AI learning activity. The learning activity consisted of 90-min sessions once per week for five weeks. Before the learning activity, the teacher clarified the learning objectives and administered a pretest. The teacher then instructed the students on the features, supervised learning and unsupervised learning units. After the learning activity, the teacher conducted a posttest. We analyzed the students' prior knowledge and learning performance by evaluating their pretest and posttest results and observing their learning behaviors in the AI learning activity. Findings: (1) Students used Feature City to learn AI concepts to improve their learning outcomes. (2) Female students learned more effectively with Feature City than male students. (3) Male students were more likely than female students to complete the learning tasks in Feature City the first time they used it. Originality/value: Within SDGs, this study used STEM and extended reality technologies to develop Feature City to engage students in learning about AI. The study examined how much Feature City improved students' learning outcomes and explored the differences in their learning outcomes and behaviors. The results showed that students' use of Feature City helped to improve their learning outcomes. Female students achieved better learning outcomes than their male counterparts. Male students initially exhibited a behavioral pattern of seeking clarification and error analysis when learning AI education, more so than their female counterparts. The findings can help teachers adjust AI education appropriately to match the tutorial content with students' AI learning needs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

This study aims to examine the relationship between students’ demographic characteristics and their academic achievement at the pre-diploma level using machine learning. Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data analysis was used in this study, which involved collecting information about 1,052 pre-diploma students enrolled at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang Branch between 2017 and 2021. The research procedure was divided into two parts: data collecting and pre-processing, and building the machine learning algorithm, pre-training and testing. Findings: Gender, family income, region and achievement in the national secondary school examination (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia [SPM]) predict academic performance. Female students were 1.2 times more likely to succeed academically. Central region students performed better with a value of 1.26. M40-income students were more likely to excel with an odds ratio of 2.809. Students who excelled in SPM English and Mathematics had a better likelihood of succeeding in higher education. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited to pre-diploma students from UiTM Pahang Branch. For better generalizability of the results, future research should include pre-diploma students from other UiTM branches that offer this programme. Practical implications: This study is expected to offer insights for policymakers, particularly, the Ministry of Higher Education, in developing a comprehensive policy to improve the tertiary education system by focusing on the fourth Sustainable Development Goal. Social implications: These pre-diploma students were found to originate mainly from low- or middle-income families; hence, the programme may help them acquire better jobs and improve their standard of living. Most students enrolling on the pre-diploma performed below excellent at the secondary school level and were therefore given the opportunity to continue studying at a higher level. Originality/value: This predictive model contributes to guidelines on the minimum requirements for pre-diploma students to gain admission into higher education institutions by ensuring the efficient distribution of resources and equal access to higher education among all communities. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A systematic literature review: Recent techniques of predicting STEM stream students;"Ismail N.; Yusof U.K.";2023;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;Review;Scopus;10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100141;;;Yes;;Nowadays, fewer students are choosing to enroll in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. STEM students in schools and in higher educational institutions appear to be waning, as evidenced by low secondary school STEM enrolments. To add to this, there are also STEM stream students who dropped out and switched to non-STEM streams. This resulted in a shortage of qualified candidates for STEM-based higher education programmes, and subsequently an insufficient number of STEM graduates. Researchers have found several potential contributing factors that may have impacted students’ selection of STEM. However, this relationship is still unclear and needs further investigation. This goal of this systematic review is to assess the factors that can be used to predict students’ selection of a STEM major using existing techniques. To do this, PRISMA's Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process was used to map the findings of previous studies based on the designed research questions (RQs). More specifically, the objective of this analysis was to compile, summarise, and assess related works in order to identify current contributing variables, potential techniques, dataset characteristics, challenges, and future directions within the scope of this investigation. Papers published in major online scientific databases, including Science Direct, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM, ProQuest, and Springer, between 2011 and April 2021 were identified and analyzed. Although there were 1248 publications found through extensive SLR selection processes using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 121 articles were selected. After being analyzed, only 16 articles were found to have discussed about machine learning (ML) techniques and showed that the most accurate predictions were possible based on different variables or factors. In addition, the dataset characteristics were found to have impacted the accuracy of the prediction results. However, the available evidences were limited, and the output findings from each study reviewed were relatively diverse. Therefore, evidences discussing the potential usefulness of ML techniques to analyse the relationship between contributing factors should be strengthened. © 2023 The Authors
From Theory to Training: Exploring Teachers' Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence in Education;"Fissore C.; Floris F.; Fradiante V.; Conte M.M.; Sacchet M.";2024;International Conference on Computer Supported Education, CSEDU - Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.5220/0012734700003693;;;Yes;;Every year, there is increasing interest in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and systems in education. Educating students about the conscious use of AI and its challenges is essential. Still, even before that, it is necessary to educate teachers who need to acquire the necessary skills to use these technologies in the classroom to enrich their students' learning experience. Training must be theoretical and guide teachers in designing educational activities with AI, about AI, and preparing for AI. This article presents research conducted in Italy to understand educators' attitudes toward AI in Education. Responses to a nationwide questionnaire are analysed to understand the relationship between teachers at all levels of schooling and AI. The results show that teachers need more confidence in their AI skills but are also not too concerned about the increasing spread of AI at various levels. From the findings, we can also say that AI has found little space in the school activities of Italian teachers. At the same time, teachers state that they urgently need to be trained on AI issues.

Artificial Intelligence in Secondary Education: An Innovative Teacher’s Tool to Ensure Individualised Learning for Students;"Lytvynova S.; Vodopian N.; Sysoeva O.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-63235-8_26;;;Yes;;In recent years, the digital transformation of society has characterised access to the Internet as a prerequisite for educational activities. Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new opportunities for developing individualised learning for students. A 2023 study analyses the results of using artificial intelligence by teachers of Ukrainian secondary schools. The main goal of the survey is to determine the state of AI applications for individualised learning and the integration of this technology into pedagogical practice. The study examines the timing of digital technology implementation and its impact on the continuous development of teachers’ digital competencies. Particular attention is paid to the aspects of AI implementation, including educational purposes, teacher readiness, and limitations of this technology. It is established that to implement individualised learning, the goal and objectives of individualisation, the choice of AI services and platforms, opportunities for students, security measures, learning pace, level of mastery of the material and personal interests should be considered. The author proposes a classification of tasks for students using AI and provides examples of assessments for students of grades 7–9 in English, mathematics, and biology. Emphasis is given to the fact that AI-powered automatic assessment enables the recognition of the requirements of every individual student and adapts learning tasks according to their current abilities and knowledge. Despite the challenges and problems of integrating AI into the school environment, the study points to the growing interest of teachers in this technology, the improvement of AI capabilities, and its gradual development as a teacher’s assistant. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
Emotional expression in mathematics e-learning using emojis: A gender-based analysis;"Zarkadoulas D.; Virvou M.";2024;Intelligent Decision Technologies;Article;Scopus;10.3233/IDT-240170;;;Yes;;Emotional feeling is a phase of neurobiological activity that plays an important role in cognitive thinking and learning, although largely overlooked in complex tutoring fields like Mathematics. This paper introduces an innovative e-learning Mathematics course integrating emojis as a feedback mechanism to express students’ emotional responses towards mathematical challenges. By providing a platform for intuitive emotional expression, this approach aims to strengthen engagement and comprehension. Through empirical investigation, emotional reactions of online mathematics students are explored, with attention to gender-related differences in emoji usage. A survey administered to 100 students prompts them to select emojis conveying their sentiments towards mathematical problems. Statistical analyses reveal that emojis effectively capture students’ emotions, with an emphasis on gender-based variations in selection. These insights illuminate the dynamics of emotional expression and hold implications for fostering comprehensive learning environments that mitigate negative emotions such as mathematical anxiety. By empowering educators to monitor students’ emotional reactions and adapt teaching strategies accordingly, this approach has the potential to cultivate confident and proficient learners essential for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) advancement. © 2024 – IOS Press.

Low-achievement risk assessment with machine learning;"Zanellati A.; Zingaro S.P.; Gabbrielli M.";2023;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In this work, we propose a method for assessing the risk of low-achievement in secondary school with data collected from the Italian ministry of education. Low-achievement is a phenomenon whereby a student, despite completing his or her education, does not reach the level of competence expected by the school system. We train three machine learning models on a large, real dataset through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests and compare the results in terms of predictive and descriptive performance. We exploit data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low-achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Evaluating Productivity of Learning Habits Using Math Learning Logs: Do K12 Learners Manage Their Time Effectively?;"Hsu C.-Y.; Horikoshi I.; Li H.; Majumdar R.; Ogata H.";2024;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_12;;;Yes;;Habits refer to behaviors that occur repetitively. As ICT tools spread widely in learners’ school lives, the Learning Analytics (LA) techniques enable researchers to monitor learners’ daily activities and understand their habitual behaviors via fine-grained analysis of the log data that traces one’s actions in digital environments. While types of learning habits were commonly evaluated with academic performance, little evaluation focused on whether the existing habit types involve high learning productivity. Therefore, this study evaluates the productivity of habit types using effective time management factors, including effectiveness, efficiency, and effortlessness. We collected learning logs from 114 learners at the age of 15 on average in a Japanese junior high school. Specifically, we analyzed their self-directed learning of doing math exercises from Apr. 2022 to Feb. 2023. The findings strengthen the importance of teaching and learning process through a better time management strategy in terms of building learning habits, where many students face difficulties. As the implications of this study, we could support learners in time awareness and time adjusting by recommending an appropriate type of learning habits considering its productivity. Hence, the regular scheduling of learning activities can not only improve the learning productivity of learners but also cultivate skills of self-directed learning with effective time management. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz;"Boateng G.; Mensah J.A.; Yeboah K.T.; Edor W.; Mensah-Onumah A.K.; Ibrahim N.D.; Yeboah N.S.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_17;;;Yes;;The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: “Build an AI to compete live in Ghana’s National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition”. The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
Attitudes towards and expectations on the role of artificial intelligence in the classroom among digitally skilled Finnish K-12 mathematics teachers;"Pörn R.; Braskén M.; Wingren M.; Andersson S.";2024;LUMAT;Article;Scopus;10.31129/LUMAT.12.3.2102;;;Yes;;The growing impact and importance of artificial intelligence in society has led to an increasing interest for the potential of artificial intelligence as an educational tool in schools to aid both students and teachers. In this study we investigate dig-itally skilled K-12 mathematics teachers' (N=85) attitudes towards and expecta-tions on the role of artificial intelligence in the classroom. The study was done by conducting and analyzing the results of a web-based survey among Swedish and Finnish speaking mathematics teachers using a mixed methods strategy. The Will, Skill and Tool framework was used for the analysis. The survey was done before the introduction of ChatGPT-3. The results indicate that the teachers' attitudes toward AI tools in school are characterized by interest, openness, and awareness. Teachers have a balanced view on the possibilities and risks of AI use in school. However, the teachers also stress that there is a risk that AI tools will shift the focus from learning key mathematical skills towards learning and interaction with the AI tools themselves. The research concluded that the K-12 mathematics teachers surveyed have broad experience with digital tools and will likely become early adopters of AI tools in the classroom. © 2024 University of Helsinki.

AGILEST approach: Using machine learning agents to facilitate kinesthetic learning in STEM education through real-time touchless hand interaction;"Zahid Iqbal M.; Campbell A.G.";2023;Telematics and Informatics Reports;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.teler.2022.100034;;;Yes;Yes;There is an increasing interest in creating interactive learning applications using innovative interaction technologies, especially in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. Recent developments in machine learning have allowed for nearly perfect hand-tracking recognition, introducing a touchless modality for interaction within Augmented Reality (AR) environments. However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or “Learning by Doing”, hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world. Meanwhile, machine learning has gained attention for its ability to enhance personalized learning and play a vital new role as a virtual instructor. This paper proposes a novel approach called the AGILEST approach, which uses machine learning Agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in STEM education through touchless interaction. The first case study for this approach will be an AR learning application for chemistry. This application uses real-time touchless hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and uses a machine learning agent to act as both trainer and assessor of the user. The evaluation of this research has been conducted remotely through a usability study with expert reviewers, which includes 15 young researchers with peer-reviewed work in Human-Computer Interaction & AR and 2 subject experts STEM teachers at the secondary school level. The usability evaluation through NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), Perceived Ease of Use (PUEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) with expert reviewers provide positive feedback about this approach for productive learning gain, engagement and interactiveness in learning STEM subjects. © 2022 The Author(s)
Developing a cognitive model of solid geometry based on Interpretive Structural Modeling method;"Zhang H.; Wu X.; Ju M.";2024;Heliyon;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27063;;;Yes;Yes;With the advancement of science and artificial intelligence, education is experiencing significant innovation. The adaptive learning system is emerging as a promising approach to achieving personalized learning. The cognitive model plays a crucial role as the fundamental rationale behind the adaptive learning system. Currently, there is no uniform and highly operational method for constructing cognitive models. This study adopts Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) as the foundational approach for constructing a cognitive model of solid geometry. Based on literature and expert opinions, 17 cognitive attributes of high school solid geometry were identified. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey involving 40 experts was conducted to establish the contextual relationships among these attributes. Applying the ISM method resulted in a seven-level model. This model was then revised based on expert opinions to create the final cognitive model, revealing three primary paths within the domain of high school solid geometry. This paper contends that the use of the ISM method for constructing cognitive models is effective and objective. The resulting cognitive model unveils the content structure of high school solid geometry, and provides an innovative perspective on the construction of cognitive models. © 2024 The Authors
Predicting secondary school student performance using a double particle swarm optimization-based categorical boosting model;"Fan Z.; Gou J.; Wang C.";2023;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106649;;;Yes;Yes;Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

WIP: Bridging the Data Gap - Introducing Unplugged Data Science;"Arboleda M.; Vieira C.; Chiu J.L.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893521;;Yes;Yes;;This innovative practice paper outlines a design-based research study to enhance data science literacy in students using an unplugged approach. With the rapid growth of data and its impact on daily life, there's a need for new educational methods to help students understand and use data effectively. Data science involves math, statistics, computation, AI, and machine learning, but teaching these concepts can be challenging without access to computers or the internet, potentially widening educational inequities. Inspired by unplugged computer science education, this study supports data science education in unplugged classrooms. Initial research focused on creating and testing two learning units on data visualization and summarization using innovative activities and reflection prompts. Analyzing students' work from a pilot with ten eleventh-graders in a low-income public school in a Global South country, the study aims to understand how these activities support data visualization skills and identify limitations. Future work will develop and implement lesson plans to promote data and AI literacy, aiming to make data science education more inclusive across diverse backgrounds. © 2024 IEEE.
AI-based Learning Assistants: Enhancing Math Learning for Migrant Students in German Schools;"Kretzschmar V.; Seitz J.";2024;Proceedings - 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence, CAI 2024;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00035;;;Yes;;"Increasing migration leads the education landscape to face the challenge of integrating children into the school system, accounting for inherent disadvantages. On average, as nearly half of them face socio-economic disadvantages, a persistent performance disparity was observed compared to domestic students. Remarkably, even after mitigating the influence of socioeconomic status, immigrant students' scores remained inferior. From March to May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project investigated how an AI-based learning assistant can compensate for existing impediments by enabling a better understanding through video-based learning. For this study, 275 students were selected from two secondary schools (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The experiment tested the extent to which learners solve more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and retain it. Students were repeatedly tested on mathematical problems, where the control group did not have access to the AI assistant. In contrast, the other group used the AI assistant to solve the problems. The students' performances from both school groups were statistically tested using t-tests. Within the test group of grammar schools, a significant change in the results between the two test days existed (T(41)=-2,28; pc.01) when the AI tool was used. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change T(37)=-.42; p>.05; d=.O7) in performance. However, the results were insignificant for the secondary school students, as the given tasks and video content were considered too demanding. Further research is needed to determine AIEDN's performance for other target groups. © 2024 IEEE."

Board 165: K-12 STEM Teachers' Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence: A PRISMA-tic Approach (Work-in-Progress);"Daniel L.K.Y.; Radloff J.D.; Yeter I.H.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Recent technological advancements have led to the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications like Gemini and ChatGPT. Consequently, these applications of AI and others have proliferated aspects of daily life. Notably, there is a growing interest in incorporating AI to enhance K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and research. To be effectively integrated, however, AI usage needs to align with teachers' existing STEM curriculum and pedagogy. In essence, the extent to which AI will be deployed in future classrooms will heavily depend on teachers' perceptions of its utility within the STEM education context. STEM teachers' attitudes, expectations, and perceived challenges regarding AI can significantly influence their willingness to adopt AI-integrated instruction approaches. Identifying and categorizing teachers' beliefs, motivational factors, and areas of concern will provide practical insights for STEM curriculum designers, professional developers, and policymakers. This study investigates these possible directions through a lens of major established models of integrated STEM education. Although extensive research has been done on integrating AI with STEM, work is lacking that translates this concept into concrete entry points for integration. To address this gap, this research uses a systematic literature review (SLR) approach focusing on preservice teachers' (PSTs') perceptions of AI in STEM education. Using the PRISMA model, we gathered related empirical, peer-reviewed articles published from 2020 to 2024. Of the 250 initial studies, 26 met our eventual criteria. Content analyses of these surveys revealed several aspects that may be used to further understand PSTs' perspectives on AI's involvement and potential usage in integrated STEM. Firstly, their competency using AI tools appears to greatly influence their attitude toward AI-integrated STEM pedagogy. Second, their perceptions of AI's effectiveness, utility, and ethics seem to significantly impact their willingness to adopt AI for classroom usage. Lastly, research suggests that PSTs recognize both the benefits, like improving student engagement and personalized learning, and the challenges posed by technical difficulties or the complexity of interspersing these technologies in their STEM classrooms. As such, teacher education related to meaningfully using AI tools is an important focus of integrating AI. Teachers must be skilled and confident in using AI tools in their classrooms, while also able to recognize its limitations and potential pitfalls. PSTs, therefore, need access to targeted AI resources and opportunities for application within their STEM pedagogy courses. Meeting these goals means providing teacher educators and researchers with ongoing support to advance the integration of AI into K-12 STEM education. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.
Enhancing Computational Thinking Skills Through Artificial Intelligence Education at a STEAM High School;"Huang X.; Qiao C.";2024;Science and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1007/s11191-022-00392-6;Yes;;Yes;Yes;"Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students’ computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students’ computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group.

Research on Knowledge Graph Extraction Methods for Chinese STEM Curriculum;"Wang C.; Sang X.; Wang X.; Gao Y.; Liu Y.";2024;MLNLP 2024 - 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/MLNLP63328.2024.10800180;;;Yes;;STEM education, as an innovative teaching model, has gained widespread attention in recent years. However, the lack of relevant textBooks and learning resources has made its implementation challenging. Developing interdisciplinary knowledge graphs tailored for STEM education has become an urgent issue. To address this, a knowledge extraction framework named Llms4edu is proposed, which utilizes a series of effective prompts to guide large language models in knowledge extraction. Specifically, the knowledge extraction task is transformed into multiple rounds of question-and-answer interactions with the LLM, gradually identifying entity-relation triplets from subject data. Through experiments, an F1-score of 89.4% was achieved on the named entity recognition task in the chemistry subject, and an F1-score of 66.7% on the relation extraction task. Finally, a subject ontology model was built for subject text, and a subject data set was constructed using Llms4edu, which includes three subjects of junior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry, a total of 2,511 entities, 2,010 relationship triples, and cross-disciplinary knowledge is linked to construct a cross-disciplinary knowledge graph. © 2024 IEEE.
Improving Attitudes of Underrepresented High School Students Toward STEM: A Virtual Summer Program;"Lamkin D.; Ghosh R.; Lobodina G.; Dearborn K.; Allen S.; Asino T.I.";2023;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-981-19-9638-2_37;;;Yes;;The lack of US underrepresented and underserved students seeking professions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a pressing issue. Unfortunately, below 50% of the students who enter the STEM fields graduate with a STEM-related degree. Hence, the USA must continue to be innovative and take creative steps to compete as a world power and leader in STEM fields. If innovation and creative STEM outreach efforts shift focus from working professionals and begin targeting traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM at the secondary education level, this would increase the technical talent pool. This study examines the attitudes of students toward STEM with a near-peer mentor model and without a near-peer mentor (NPM) in a virtual STEM research-based designed experience. The pilot quantitative study design fostered a supportive, structured virtual environment in which students can gain confidence in their abilities to master STEM subjects and become motivated to strive from internally driven values to achieve. The study's results reveal how student participants experienced near-peer mentoring and non-near-peer mentoring. The study’s findings provide valuable insights for the next steps to address the needs of underrepresented and underserved groups through structuring the near-peer mentoring experience to provide continuity throughout the virtual STEM learning experience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
Differences in Academic Preparedness Do Not Fully Explain Black-White Enrollment Disparities in Advanced High School Coursework;"Souto-Maior J.M.; Shroff R.";2024;Sociological Science;Article;Scopus;10.15195/V11.A6;;;Yes;;Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central question in sociological research and education policy. However, previous investigations face methodological limitations, for they compare race-specific enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to their academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently-developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students’ academic preparedness and use administrative data from the New York City Department of Education to measure differences in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under-representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only requires equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes. © 2024 The Author(s).

Fostering Student Competencies in Creative Project Work Through STEAM and Artificial Intelligence in Teaching Art;"Kulanova F.; Baitureev D.; Singh C.P.";2023;2023 4th International Conference on Computation, Automation and Knowledge Management, ICCAKM 2023;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/ICCAKM58659.2023.10449552;;Yes;Yes;;The objective of this study is to determine if there exists a statistically significant distinction between high school pupils who get instruction in the topic of 'Art' through the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and those who receive instruction through the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). Creativity, particularly within the realm of art and design, is commonly perceived as the ability to think beyond conventional boundaries. The study posited an alternative perspective by equating computational thinking with creative thinking. A total of forty-two kids from a high school in Kazakhstan were chosen as case studies for the topic of Art. The objective is to facilitate the integration of STEM education and art-based education.  © 2023 IEEE.

Capability Assessment of Cultivating Innovative Talents for Higher Schools Based on Machine Learning;"Huang R.; Sun Y.; Zhang Z.; Wang B.; Ma J.; Chu Y.";2024;International Journal of Information and Communication Technology Education;Article;Scopus;10.4018/IJICTE.343635;;;Yes;;The innovation capability largely determines the initiative for future development of a region. Higher school is the main position for training innovative talents. Accurate and comprehensive assessment of innovation cultivation capability is an important basis of higher schools for continuous improvement. Thus, this paper focuses on assessing innovative talent cultivation capability. First, by CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product Evaluation), an assessment indicator system is built, consisting of 89 indicators in 21 categories. Then, based on indicator characteristics, this paper uses public data statistics, database retrieving, student survey, teacher survey, support personnel and expert investigation, to collect indicator values. After this, by a powerful machine learning algorithm, gradient Boosting regression tree, a capability assessment model is established. And based on collected data, established model is compared with several regression models in innovative talent cultivation capability assessing. Results confirm the performance superiority of our solution. © 2024 IGI Global. All rights reserved.
Novel Approach for Teaching AI in Entry Level Education;"Kübler S.; Bildhauer-Buggle C.; Schiepp T.";2024;New Perspectives in Science Education - International Conference;Article;Scopus;;;;Yes;;The proliferating fielding of artificial intelligence in various but especially industrial applications increases the need for pupils, students and employees in STEM areas and leads to a new job profile, the AI engineer, who does not necessarily require a full study in computer sciences. Extensive efforts are undergone to improve education at the K-12 level, but even at the university level educators are struggling to keep pace with the development of AI. At the same time, a continuous stream of presentations in digital media reveal an unbroken fascination with industrial robots, even though their emergence dates back decades. Our approach to stimulate students' interest in AI education leverages the appeal of physical interaction with an AI via a 6-DOF robot rather than an auditory or purely visual interface. In order to keep access to robot programming as a hurdle as low as possible, we expand the graphic programming ability of an industrial robot user interface with a self-designed game-card concept and combine this with an AI hard-and software that is either pre-trained or trained as part of a problem-solving exercise. We present a step-by-step approach for artificial intelligence in education (AIED) that is characterized by increasing complexity of the exercises and can therefore be adapted to offer different levels of interactive learning environments (ILE). Part of this step-by-step approach is also the presentation of the development of information processing from strictly linear (the robot control) via object-oriented (in the interaction of the AI with the robot) to the AI itself in an overall project that combines all stages and concepts. This interactive learning environment thus enables an adjustment in both the level of difficulty and-by selecting the sub-areas-the amount of time in teaching the application of AI in a real-world scenario. © 2024, Pixel Associazione.

Cybersecurity Education in High School: Exploring Cyber Assets, Cyber Value at Risk, and Authentic Assessment;"Vajpayee P.; Hossain G.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893209;;Yes;Yes;;In the realm of cybersecurity, a knowledge chasm exists among high school students. High school students face a significant gap in cybersecurity knowledge, essential for safeguarding the digital environment. This educational deficit renders them vulnerable to cyber threats, compromising personal and school-wide digital security. The global shortage of cybersecurity professionals exacerbates the issue, threatening future defenses against cyberattacks. This paper introduces Cyber Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a concept adapted from finance, to evaluate the risk to digital assets. It outlines a model using basic math and probability to assess and mitigate risks to these cyber assets, which include data, vulnerability, and potential negative impacts like financial or reputational loss at the time of cyber incident. The approach equates cyber assets to financial terms-assets, liabilities, and capital-to demonstrate how additional countermeasures can reduce cyber asset value. The paper emphasizes the importance of consistent cybersecurity practices, akin to the effects of compound interest, and aims to demystify cybersecurity for students using financial literacy and mathematical concepts. The paper uses the proposed method to calculate cyber risks for the prominent cyber-attacks such as Phishing, DDoS, Data breach, Ransom ware, and loT Vulnerabilities in the context of school. It further explains the value of problem based learning and provides an authentic assessment framework to establish a practical learning of cybersecurity concepts for high school students. Finally, it advocates for the integration of security measures in internet use, covering authentication, authorization, encryption, firewall, secure connections, and systems' upgrade to reduce cyber risks. With the rise of online education, gaming, social media, and digitalization, cyber awareness is crucial for high school students. The criticality of internet security is making cyber knowledge an urgent educational priority. Due to growing demand of loT and artificial intelligence (AI), the paper suggests future research about explaining cyber risks to high school students using machine learning, human behavior, and system anomalies. © 2024 IEEE.
Board 407: The Use of Home Technology in Preschoolers' Families in Urban Settings: Experiences and Potential Impacts;Ragusa G.;2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"Comprehensive experiences with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in pre-school settings can assist young students in learning about computer science and engineering prior to when they enter into K-12 classrooms. Such experiences are also an important way to attract more students to STEM careers. Currently however, the number of high-quality STEM education resources and materials available to preschool educators is limited. This is particularly the situation in areas of high poverty in communities that have been under-resourced longitudinally. This research addresses a gap in preschool teachers' capacity to support young children's STEM content knowledge by determining what sorts of technology is present in children's home, and how such technological experiences impact children's familiarization with and use of technology in preschool classrooms for children ages three-five. The presented study is part of a larger, National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project in which preschoolers, their teachers and their families experience an intervention to improve children's access to technology and experience in pre-engineering and early computer science education with their early childhood teachers. The referenced “umbrella” study's research questions include: (1) In what ways does the project's infusing of play-based early computer science and pre-engineering into child development programs impact young children's early computer science and pre-engineering knowledge, and their knowledge of and early interest in STEM careers? (2) What is the relationship between the project's teacher professional development and participating teachers' content knowledge of early computer science and pre-engineering and instructional performance? (3) What impact does the teachers' cyber-safety focused professional development have on the cyber-safe practices of participating preschool teachers and their young students? And (4) What role do young students' early technology experiences play in their comfort with, interest in, and understanding of technology use? The full research project referenced above employs a teacher professional development program that allows preschool educators and university STEM faculty to co-create materials and engage in teacher professional development together. This is “work in progress” research during its second year in operation with NSF funding. In the first year of the project, the research team engaged in research on the needs of teachers in diverse early childhood education settings. These results were presented last year (2023) at ASEE. This 2024 ASEE paper responds to the fourth research question (above) of the referenced larger early education study regarding children's use of and comfort with technology. This question was included in the research because the literature suggests that frequency of use of technology and familiarization with technology increases young students' interest in STEM majors in college and careers; so as researchers, we wish to determine the level of interest, experience and comfort with technology young children have in their homes and how that may impact their in-class technology familiarization and use. This is of particular importance for the population engaged with this research because 92.3% of them are considered under-resourced financially by federal poverty standards. For the present paper, we collected research data using a family/primary caregiver questionnaire on the use of technology in children's home who are in the preschools in which the teacher participants for the larger study teach. This questionnaire collected information about the types of technology the children have in their homes, whether the young children in the families witnessed use of the technology, (a proxy for learning vicariously from about technology), whether they used the technology themselves, and then compared that information to the children's use, familiarization and comfort with using technology in their preschool classroom. Results of this research indicated that the majority of the preschool children had only experiences using a smart phone or television, either vicariously or directly. Nearly 100% of the children had access to television. Of those who had smart phones in their home 64.1 percent had direct experience playing with a smart phone. Only 26% of the children had experiences with computers and these experiences were primarily vicarious, watching either a parent, other adult, or an older sibling using a computer. Very few children used a robot at home, a few had access to an e-tablet, and a very small number of children had access to musical technology. The connections to use in the classroom were rather profound. Of those who used technology other than a TV, the more frequent and the variability in technology use, the more comfortable the children were with in-class technology use per their families. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."
Assessing the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tutoring system for improving college-level mathematics preparedness in high school students;"Nehring J.; Moyer-Packenham P.; North M.";2023;Issues in Information Systems;Article;Scopus;10.48009/1_iis_2023_111;;;Yes;;Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been used to help high school students transition from the mathematics taught in high school to the mathematics expected at colleges and universities. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between high school students’ performance in Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) Placement, Preparation, and Learning (PPL) Modules and performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. The participants in this study were 100 students from five high schools in the United States. Each student was placed into one of two groups: the ALEKS Group, who completed the ALEKS Pre-Calculus Learning Modules, and the Non-ALEKS Group, who did not complete the modules. Students’ scores were compared statistically to test for significant differences. The analysis included a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to measure how assignment of the modules affected exam scores. A logistic regression was used to assess differences between the two groups in placing into college algebra. A statistically significant difference was found in exam scores between the ALEKS Group and the Non-ALEKS Group which indicated that assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Learning Modules did increase performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. Conversely, assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Modules did not increase students’ likelihood of placing into College Algebra. The amount of time students spent taking the exam influenced student outcomes on the ALEKS Mathematics Placement exam. These results show that schools could implement Intelligent Tutoring Systems into their current mathematics classrooms to help students increase their scores on college entry mathematics placement exams. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.
WIP: Understanding Students' In-Video Dropout Behavior in Large Online Math Learning Platform;"Liu Z.; Guo R.; Song Y.; Xing W.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893157;;;Yes;;This work-in-progress research paper aims to explore students' dropout behavior during video engagement in online learning platforms. As online learning becomes increasingly popular, analyzing how students engage with video content provides important insights into their learning behaviors. This study explores multiple factors influencing K-12 students' in-video dropout rates in online math education. We examined 34,666,481 log entries from Math Nation, covering 1313 videos and 14,251 students. Using survival analysis, we evaluated how 27 variables, including demographic details, video interaction behaviors, and video characteristics(e.g. length, category), affect in-video dropout. Our findings reveal that video length significantly predicts dropout, with each additional minute increasing the dropout rate by 1.26%. Videos with higher dropout rates often feature more frequent pauses, jumps, and rewatches. The study also highlights that the quality of video content, the creators of the videos, and how students interact with the videos are crucial factors affecting dropout rates. Further research is needed to determine the specific causes of video dropout. © 2024 IEEE.

Didactic Innovation in Mathematics Using Technologies;"Lopes A.P.; Soares F.; Neto C.; Fernandes M.; Monteiro M.";2024;Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"The continuous progress of society requires all the actors to be dynamic and constantly updated, both in terms of monitoring as well as in the need to adapt. Regarding education, no matter how updated we are in relation to the contents, didactic strategies, and technological resources, we are still inevitably forced to adapt to new paradigms, leading us to reformulate traditional teaching methods. In this context, the contribution of e-learning platforms emerges, where teachers and students have at their disposal new means of empowering the teaching and learning process, since these platforms can be defined as a virtual teaching support environments. Currently, our students, in general, have many difficulties in problem-solving and mathematical reasoning, which often reflects in the performance of very simple tasks, with a growing disinterest towards Mathematics. It is also possible to argue that our students' ""poor preparation"" is a contributing factor in their failure (many did not attend Mathematics in Secondary Education and/or have not studied for several years, as is the case of those who entered through special contingents, as the “aged 23 and over”). In order to promote a distinct, alternative and supportive pathway that may help to solve this issue, a project on the Moodle learning management system (LMS) platform has been developed with the goal of assisting students in their study and the development of their skills in a way that is directly related to the curricular units (CU) in the scientific field of Mathematics, in an online learning environment. To increase students’ engagement into their learning process in a collaborative environment, a flipped model was employed into a Financial Mathematics/Financial Calculus Course (FCC). This paper's primary goal is to examine the effects of implementing the flipped classroom paradigm on students' performance, learning, and classroom instruction. The results from employing this approach have indicated a beneficial effect on the overall academic progress of students. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved."
Computer Science (CS) Day for Middle School Students;"Veron T.; Iles T.; Khan Ashar A.A.; Liu J.";2023;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343497;;;Yes;;In order to generate interest in computer science and its various fields, we designed a Computer Science (CS) Day, an enriched computing program, for middle school students in October of 2022. A group of 53 middle school students was invited to our campus to learn about computer science and tour the campus. These students attended a local public school and were involved in a robotics club at their school. This paper describes our workshops at CS Day, which aimed to provide students with a better understanding of computer science and its related fields. The CS Day provided students with the opportunity to learn about computer science as a career and computer science concepts. Several lectures and activities were created to provide a fulfilling and interactive day of learning for the students. Touring our campus and interacting with college students exposed middle school students to the idea of pursuing a college degree in computer science. The students learned about careers in computer science, basic computer programming concepts, the concept of binary and how it relates to computer hardware, artificial intelligence, game design and development, and the concept of blockchain. We presented learning activities that were interactive and hands-on, allowing the students to learn by doing. By the end of the CS Day, each student had gained valuable insights into the world of computer science and its applications, which can help them make more informed decisions about future career plans. We provided pre-and post-tests for two of our workshops to assess if our workshops helped students increase their understanding of computer science concepts. The pre-and post-surveys asked questions about translating binary and performing basic math with it. Additionally, the survey asked basic questions about computers and their binary relation. During the lecture, the students were given papers to help them follow and learn from the lecture, and a binary game to test their knowledge after the lecture. Our studies show that the student scores improved by 100% or more in both workshops between the pre-and postworkshop assessments. The assessment questions were the same in the pre-and post-tests to ensure consistency. Our assessment results show that our CS Day was very successful, and it is hoped that enriched computing programs like this will encourage more young students to pursue careers in computer science and help address the growing demand for skilled professionals in the computing industry. We present this paper to share the interactive learning activities we designed, the results of pre-and post-tests we conducted with the students, and future work in the area of outreach to secondary school-aged students in the field of computer science. © 2023 IEEE.
Common School Notions to De-anthropomorphize AI. A High School Workshop Experience;Zuccarini E.;2024;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"Anthropomorphic representation of AI, emphasized by the ChatGPT media wave, was an obstacle set aside in a workshop on expert systems and machine learning applications. The experience involved the fifth-year classes of the Information Systems Articulation at the Technical-Economic High School ""Jacopo Barozzi"" in Modena. The students understood the statistical recombination work that GPTs do, but overall broadened their vision of what historically has been defined time to time as AI. Then, doing an exercise in Prolog followed by examples of machine learning paradigms, they focused on the differences between the two branches. It emerged a need of curricular applied mathematics, especially statistics. On the positive side, that workshop gave students a pragmatic and familiar attitude toward AI applications. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its author."
The integration of digital games into teaching and learning—A unique constructivist framework;"Liat E.; Hayak M.";2024;British Journal of Educational Technology;Article;Scopus;10.1111/bjet.13555;;;Yes;;In today's era, the ability to create and utilize digital games in the classroom is of great importance, for both teachers and students. Yet traditional teaching methods often lack the implementation of games in general, and of digital games in particular. This study presents a unique constructivist framework for creating and integrating digital-game generators in the classroom, following four consecutive year-long courses for preservice teachers at a college in Israel. Using design-based research, year-to-year improvements (iterations) to the course were introduced, achieved through analysis of in-class discussions, semi-structured interviews, participants' reflective diaries and the generated games. The participants were required to apply the constructivist framework to a study unit in their field of expertise, during their practical school-teaching experience. The findings in this study are based on the participants' teaching experience in secondary schools in three core subjects: English as a second language, mathematics and history. The developed consecutive framework comprises three core elements: the game, the pedagogical and didactic core, and the knowledge—all of which are important when integrating digital-game generators into the classroom. The course and framework addressed in this study could be applied in additional teacher-training programs, to increase digital-game generation and related skills in classrooms. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Creating and implementing digital games in the classroom has gained momentum in recent years. Early exposure of preservice teachers to digital games during the teaching training phase may increase their use in the educational field. The developing and integration of digital games in the classroom, based on the constructivist approach, allows students to create games using existing game generators, while expressing their insights and knowledge in a personal and creative manner. What this paper adds Introduces an innovative framework integrating educational game generation into teacher training, addressing key pedagogical and content knowledge components. Demonstrates the successful application of this framework across multiple disciplines (English, mathematics and history) in secondary education. Presents a longitudinal study showcasing the iterative development and refinement of a game-based learning approach in preservice teacher education. Provides evidence-based insights into the effectiveness of incorporating digital game creation as a constructivist learning tool in teacher preparation programs. Implications for practice and/or policy The constructivist framework helps expose preservice teachers—and in early stages of their teacher training—to experimenting with different types of digital games and different methods for integrating them into their teaching. Such integration of digital games into their teaching may promote meaningful learning, with an emphasis on the development of important 21st-century skills. In light of the proposed model, the study recommends promoting the topic of digital games in teacher training, for the benefit of the preservice teachers' future students. © 2024 British Educational Research Association.
Introduction to Probability, Statistics & R: Foundations for Data-Based Sciences;Sahu S.K.;2024;Introduction to Probability, Statistics and R: Foundations for Data-Based Sciences;Book;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-37865-2;;;Yes;;A strong grasp of elementary statistics and probability, along with basic skills in using R, is essential for various scientific disciplines reliant on data analysis. This Book serves as a gateway to learning statistical methods from scratch, assuming a solid background in high school mathematics.

Novel Feature-Based Difficulty Prediction Method for Mathematics Items Using XGBoost-Based SHAP Model;"Yi X.; Sun J.; Wu X.";2024;Mathematics;Article;Scopus;10.3390/math12101455;;;Yes;Yes;The level of difficulty of mathematical test items is a critical aspect for evaluating test quality and educational outcomes. Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China’s Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the “black box” nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students’ learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice. © 2024 by the authors.
Predicting Math Performance in High School Students using Machine Learning Techniques;hui Y.;2024;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;Article;Scopus;10.14569/IJACSA.2024.0150516;;;Yes;Yes;In the field of education, understanding and predicting student performance plays a crucial role in improving the quality of system management decisions. In this study, the power of various machine learning techniques to learn the complicated task of predicting students’ performance in math courses using demographic data of 395 students was investigated. Predicting students’ performance through demographic information makes it possible to predict their performance before the start of the course. Filtered and wrapper feature selection methods were used to find 10 important features in predicting students’ final math grades. Then, all the features of the data set as well as the 10 selected features of each of the feature selection methods were used as input for the regression analysis with the Adaboost model. Finally, the prediction performance of each of these feature sets in predicting students’ math grades was evaluated using criteria such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient and mean squared error. The best result was obtained from feature selection by the LASSO method. After the LASSO method for feature selection, the Extra Tree and Gradient Boosting Machine methods respectively had the best prediction of the final math grade. The present study showed that the LASSO feature selection technique integrated with regression analysis with the Adaboost model is a suitable data mining framework for predicting students’ mathematical performance. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

Using fair AI to predict students’ math learning outcomes in an online platform;"Li C.; Xing W.; Leite W.";2024;Interactive Learning Environments;Article;Scopus;10.1080/10494820.2022.2115076;;;Yes;;As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.
Machine learning prediction and analysis of students’ academic performance;"Pasic M.; Vatres A.; Ferizbegovic F.; Bajric H.; Pasic M.";2023;Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences;Article;Scopus;10.21533/pen.v11i5.3793;;;Yes;;Analyzing students’ academic performance is important for evaluating enrollment criteria which establish the standards required for pupils who finished secondary school to gain admission to a higher education institution. The aims of this research were to develop a machine learning prediction Decision Tree classification model and analyze the performance of engineering students based on their performances during secondary school education. The performance of students was analyzed and measured as a binomial response whether students successfully finished the first and the second study years. The developed model examined general success, number of awards obtained at competitions, special awards, average grades in mathematics, physics, and one of the official state languages during secondary school as predictor variables. The number of courses transferred from the first into the second study year and students’ GPA obtained during the first study year were added as predictor variables in the analysis and development of a prediction model for the students’ performance during the second study year and their enrollment in the third study year. Developed machine learning prediction model showed that for the performance of enrolled students in the first study year general success of students during secondary school is the most important predictor variable, followed by mathematics and physics grades. However, for the performance of the students enrolled in the second study year the most important predictor variable was number of the courses transferred from the first into the second study year, followed by students’ GPA obtained during the first study year and general success. Machine learning Decision Tree classification modeling was shown to be an adequate tool for the prediction of the performance of engineering students during the first and second study years. © The Author 2023.

Exploring Strategies to Promote Engagement and Active Learning through Digital Course Design in Engineering Mathematics;"Kula F.; Horstman E.M.; Lanting L.S.; ten Klooster L.R.";2023;SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.21427/5QFW-PY91;;;Yes;;This research explores the strategies and techniques used to foster and promote the engagement and active learning of engineering students within a digital course. This digital course has been developed to address the varying levels of understanding of fundamental mathematics among first-year engineering students, who often have disparate levels of prior knowledge at their high school completion. We observe an increasing need to bridge the widening gap between high school and university mathematics in order to prevent engineering students from being hindered in their academic successes due to a lack of prior mathematical understanding. With a team of engineers and mathematicians, both researchers and educators, we are developing a mathematics Bridging Course including the use of digital tools, such as videos, online interactions and technology-based assessments. These sources were created, investigated and/or modified to develop an engaging learning environment in which students are made aware of and guided through misconceptions and mistakes in their understanding of fundamental mathematics. In the development of this Bridging Course, we consider the importance of interactive learning and timely feedback for student learning. We investigate the impact of digital course design on students' performance and learning outcomes using a qualitative approach. Students feedback within the first stage of the implementation of the course offered a positive assessment of the course, accentuating its inherent advantages and attributes. The students' feedback proved to be an invaluable source of insights, specifically concerning the enhancement of question distractors, thus prompting revisions and augmentations in the assessment items employed. © 2023 SEFI 2023 - 51st Annual Conference of the European Society for Engineering Education: Engineering Education for Sustainability, Proceedings.

Exploring Programming Language Choices to Boost Student Interest in Coding and Educational Robotics;"Negrini L.; Marras A.; Giang C.; Babazadeh M.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-67351-1_1;;;Yes;;This research explores the impact of two widely used visual programming languages, VPL and Blockly, in educational robotics (ER) to enhance computational skills and address Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) gender disparities in K-12 education. To do so, an escape game was designed wherein children were tasked with programming a robot using either VPL or Blockly. The study gathered responses from 1635 children across 604 groups, primarily aged between 11 and 14. Statistical analysis revealed that girls tended to favour VPL more frequently than boys, while boys showed a preference for Blockly. Furthermore, participants with prior programming experience were more inclined to opt for Blockly, perceiving it as easier and more enjoyable. In sum, VPL emerged as the most utilized and preferred language, hailed for its ease of use and entertainment value compared to Blockly. These findings underscore VPL's appeal among K-12 students, particularly for girls and those lacking prior programming exposure and can be used to design learning activities and to train future teachers in ER. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
Improving Academic Advising in Engineering Education with Machine Learning Using a Real-World Dataset;"Maphosa M.; Doorsamy W.; Paul B.";2024;Algorithms;Article;Scopus;10.3390/a17020085;;;Yes;Yes;The role of academic advising has been conducted by faculty-student advisors, who often have many students to advise quickly, making the process ineffective. The selection of the incorrect qualification increases the risk of dropping out, changing qualifications, or not finishing the qualification enrolled in the minimum time. This study harnesses a real-world dataset comprising student records across four engineering disciplines from the 2016 and 2017 academic years at a public South African university. The study examines the relative importance of features in models for predicting student performance and determining whether students are better suited for extended or mainstream programmes. The study employs a three-step methodology, encompassing data pre-processing, feature importance selection, and model training with evaluation, to predict student performance by addressing issues such as dataset imbalance, biases, and ethical considerations. By relying exclusively on high school performance data, predictions are based solely on students’ abilities, fostering fairness and minimising biases in predictive tasks. The results show that removing demographic features like ethnicity or nationality reduces bias. The study’s findings also highlight the significance of the following features: mathematics, physical sciences, and admission point scores when predicting student performance. The models are evaluated, demonstrating their ability to provide accurate predictions. The study’s results highlight varying performance among models and their key contributions, underscoring the potential to transform academic advising and enhance student decision-making. These models can be incorporated into the academic advising recommender system, thereby improving the quality of academic guidance. © 2024 by the authors.
CONIC10K: A Challenging Math Problem Understanding and Reasoning Dataset;"Wu H.; Hui W.; Chen Y.; Wu W.; Tu K.; Zhou Y.";2023;Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023;Conference paper;Scopus;10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.427;;;Yes;;Mathematical understanding and reasoning are crucial tasks for assessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing benchmarks either require just a few steps of reasoning, or only contain a small amount of data in one specific topic, making it hard to analyse AI's behaviour with reference to different problems within a specific topic in detail. In this work, we propose CONIC10K, a challenging math problem dataset on conic sections in Chinese senior high school education. Our dataset contains various problems with different reasoning depths, while only the knowledge from conic sections is required. Since the dataset only involves a narrow range of knowledge, it is easy to separately analyse the knowledge a model possesses and the reasoning ability it has. For each problem, we provide a high-quality formal representation, the reasoning steps, and the final solution. Experiments show that existing large language models, including GPT-4, exhibit weak performance on complex reasoning. We hope that our findings could inspire more advanced techniques for precise natural language understanding and reasoning.

Predicting academic success of autistic students in higher education;"Bakker T.; Krabbendam L.; Bhulai S.; Meeter M.; Begeer S.";2023;Autism;Article;Scopus;10.1177/13623613221146439;;;Yes;;Individuals with autism increasingly enroll in universities, but little is known about predictors for their success. This study developed predictive models for the academic success of autistic bachelor students (N = 101) in comparison to students with other health conditions (N = 2465) and students with no health conditions (N = 25,077). We applied propensity score weighting to balance outcomes. The research showed that autistic students’ academic success was predictable, and these predictions were more accurate than predictions of their peers’ success. For first-year success, study choice issues were the most important predictors (parallel program and application timing). Issues with participation in pre-education (missingness of grades in pre-educational records) and delays at the beginning of autistic students’ studies (reflected in age) were the most influential predictors for the second-year success and delays in the second and final year of their bachelor’s program. In addition, academic performance (average grades) was the strongest predictor for degree completion in 3 years. These insights can enable universities to develop tailored support for autistic students. Using early warning signals from administrative data, institutions can lower dropout risk and increase degree completion for autistic students. Laymen Summary: What is already known about the topic? Autistic youths increasingly enter universities. We know from existing research that autistic students are at risk of dropping out or studying delays. Using machine learning and historical information of students, researchers can predict the academic success of bachelor students. However, we know little about what kind of information can predict whether autistic students will succeed in their studies and how accurate these predictions will be. What does this article add? In this research, we developed predictive models for the academic success of 101 autistic bachelor students. We compared these models to 2,465 students with other health conditions and 25,077 students without health conditions. The research showed that the academic success of autistic students was predictable. Moreover, these predictions were more precise than predictions of the success of students without autism. For the success of the first bachelor year, concerns with aptitude and study choice were the most important predictors. Participation in pre-education and delays at the beginning of autistic students’ studies were the most influential predictors for second-year success and delays in the second and final year of their bachelor’s program. In addition, academic performance in high school was the strongest predictor for degree completion in 3 years. Implications for practice, research, or policy These insights can enable universities to develop tailored support for autistic students. Using early warning signals from administrative data, institutions can lower dropout risk and increase degree completion for autistic students. © The Author(s) 2023.

However, there are still challenges in the way math is taught through video games, such as insufficient adaptation to diverse learning styles and limited flexibility in topic selection. These limitations have created a need for configurable video games that can be tailored to meet specific learning objectives while engaging students in an enjoyable and interactive manner. In response to the demand for more adaptable educational tools, this study introduces 'Dino Math Legacy', a customizable video game designed to reinforce math learning for first-year high school students, aligned with Peru's National Basic Education Curriculum. Teachers have the ability to tailor the game to specific learning goals, ensuring engagement through interactive and enjoyable experiences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a video game in improving math learning for first-year high school students, focusing on its impact on engagement and learning outcomes. A mixed-methods evaluation confirmed the game's positive impact on learning outcomes and its successful integration of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, which enhance user experience and learning. Additionally, the study found that the game improved math learning by incorporating dynamic and interactive features, such as adaptive problem-solving challenges, tailored to individual learning styles. The game's customizable features allowed teachers to modify content and set specific learning objectives, which enhanced student motivation and improved comprehension of key math concepts. The research highlights the potential of educational video games in classroom learning, emphasizing the importance of aligning design with student learning styles. A user-centered design approach, guided by educational psychologists and frameworks like LEGA and LM-GM, ensured effectiveness. A comprehensive mixed-methods evaluation, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative analysis, validated the game's effectiveness in improving math learning outcomes. © 2024 IEEE.
Identifying Personalized Support Methods Toward Mathematical Learning;"Tada M.; Takagi M.";2024;2024 IEEE International Conference on Teaching, Assessment and Learning for Engineering, TALE 2024 - Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/TALE62452.2024.10834325;;;Yes;;In recent years, the acceleration of informatization in school education in Japan has necessitated support mechanisms that allows children to understand their own learning status and adjust their learning autonomously by utilizing learning histories. However, in mathematics education, which is strongly connected to prerequisite knowledge, it is difficult to objectively identify where weaknesses arise. Therefore, it is considered increasingly important to provide learning support that enables students to understand their own comprehension status and to decide on the next learning units or problems to tackle. In this study, we propose a method to support learners in identifying their learning weaknesses and selecting problems to work on in mathematics education by marking the weakness level and subjective comprehension status on a Task Analysis chart. The implementation of this method in high school classes showed that considering subjective comprehension status allowed students to recognize areas of uncertain understanding and gain new insights into their learning weaknesses. Additionally, displaying the weakness level on the Task Analysis chart was suggested to be helpful in deciding which problems to work on next. © 2024 IEEE.

This study examines the PISA dataset containing immigrant student information from nations like the UAE, New Zealand, Canada, Qatar, Spain, and Australia. As a result, they place a high priority on analyzing the performance of immigrant students to provide them with a high-quality education. Based on the data analysis and interpretation of the findings, factors like early arrival, late arrival, wealth factors, family circumstances, and a multitude of other socioeconomic factors have an influence on the performance of students in reading, math, and science scores. The proposed OptCatB model makes predictions regarding the academic success of immigrant students by applying an optimized CatBoost regressor by keeping reading, math, and science as target variables. We trained the model using the optimized parameters after tuning the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm by using a hyperparameter optimization technique termed Optuna. The OptCatB model outperformed compared to the other selected regression models with RMSE of 54.231, MAE of 43.104, MAPE of 9.931 and RSE of 0.54. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

Are perfect transcripts necessary when we analyze classroom dialogue using AIoT?;"Wang D.; Chen G.";2024;Internet of Things (Netherlands);Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.iot.2024.101105;;;Yes;Yes;Classroom dialogue plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning. Many researchers have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) to develop models and systems for automatic analysis and feedback. However, the question of whether we should employ these AIoT tools on automatic transcripts of classroom dialogue generated by automatic speech recognition software or on transcripts that have undergone human revision remains unresolved, which involves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Thus, this paper examines whether perfect transcripts are needed to analyze talk moves in classroom dialogue. We initially constructed two deep learning models to analyze teacher talk moves in K-12 mathematics lessons. Subsequently, we collected an additional set of six K-12 mathematics lesson videos and used a classroom dialogue analysis system equipped with speech recognition software to automatically transcribe them, resulting in ASR_pure transcripts. These transcripts were then manually revised and verified to create ASR_human transcripts. A comparison between the two types of transcripts revealed evident errors in the ASR_pure transcripts. Next, we employed the developed AI models to predict talk moves in both ASR_pure and ASR_human transcripts and assessed their consistency. The findings demonstrate a high level of consistency in talk move prediction between the two types of transcripts across the six lessons. Furthermore, the ASR_pure transcripts also exhibit high consistency in specific talk moves (e.g., pressing for accuracy) when compared to ASR_human transcripts. We propose a hypoThesis that this consistency between inaccurate ASR_pure transcripts and perfect ASR_human transcripts can be attributed to the ASR software accurately recognizing key indicators that serve as talk moves, rather than accurately identifying every word. Notably, upon removing the key indicator words from teacher utterances, both the talk move level and lesson level consistency experience a substantial decline. Therefore, we suggest that perfect transcripts of classroom dialogue may not be necessary for AIoT to analyze teacher talk moves and provide teachers with prompt and accurate feedback, especially when the ASR software can accurately recognize keywords. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

ML4STEM Professional Development Program: Enriching K-12 STEM Teaching with Machine Learning;"Tang J.; Zhou X.; Wan X.; Daley M.; Bai Z.";2023;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Scopus;10.1007/s40593-022-00292-4;Yes;;Yes;;The advances of machine learning (ML) in scientific discovery (SD) reveal exciting opportunities to utilize it as a cross-cutting tool for inquiry-based learning in K-12 STEM classrooms. There are, however, limited efforts on providing teachers with sufficient knowledge and skills to integrate ML into teaching. Our study addresses this gap by proposing a professional development (PD) program named ML4STEM. Based on existing research on supporting teacher learning in innovative technology integration, ML4STEM is composed of Teachers-as-Learners and Teachers-as-Designers sessions. It integrates an accessible ML learning platform designed for students with limited math and computing skills. We implemented this PD program and evaluated its effectiveness with 18 K-12 STEM teachers. Findings confirm that ML4STEM successfully develops teachers’ understanding of teaching STEM with ML as well as fosters positive attitudes toward applying the ML as an in-class teaching technology.

Pre-Introductory Programming for College Students: Driving Engagement, Motivation, and Creativity to Drive Interest in Computing Studies;"Magitay-Becht A.; Das U.";2024;Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893164;;;Yes;;"This innovative practice paper presents an approach to make computer science (CS) in general and programming in particular more approachable for college students. Introductory programming classes can be difficult for learners; especially those without any programming background. Beginners must learn a new way of thinking, made more difficult by issues learning syntax. It's especially hard for students who lack a strong mathematics background. Observations across 3 editions of a CS0 pre-intro-programming course show that students consistently overestimate difficulties, and, come away with a stronger motivation for studying programming in the future as well as considering computer science (CS) and data science (DS) majors, minors, and certificates as options for future study after completion. A wider variety of students consider CS-adjacent college programs, and this can have an appreciable impact on the diversity of the student body entering CS/DS programs. We have found that long term success in CS/DS is predicted by strong motivational factors. While many high school students bring a strong motivation for pursuing CS/DS due to socioeconomic factors (exposure through people they know) and availability of coursework in high school; for other students, some may not have considered CS/DS as an option due to perceived difficulty as well as steep math requirements that function as barriers-to-entry. A CS0 pre-programming course like ours explicitly centers itself as 'coding-is-fun' and encourages creativity. Students engage strongly with and are motivated to put in extra outside-of-class work required for mastery of material. We have limited evidence due to the fact that the data we have is from our small liberal arts college, however, 2 key factors make our observations and analysis valuable: 1) being a Hispanic-Serving-Institution (HSI) and an Asian-American and Native-American Pacific-Islander Serving-Institution (AANAPISI) we have a diverse student body, and 2) we are not a highly selective college which brings in a wide variety of students in terms of prior preparation. Having a CS0 pre-programming' coding-is-fun' allows this diverse student body to 'test-the-waters' and, if interested, to pursue further CS/DS education by reducing the barrier-to-entry. We present data on: student perceptions before/after taking the course; the numbers of students considering further study including the breakdown of course-based vs self-study; and the tremendous numbers of students who find coding easier and therefore something they will use in their future life regardless of whether they formally plan to study CS/DS. The final point is critical in terms of adjusting to life in the 21st century as many fields/professions continue to increasingly be influenced by information and data technologies. © 2024 IEEE."
Prediction of Secondary School Students’ Academic Achievements with Machine Learning Methods and a Sample System;"?ahin S.; Erol Ç.";2024;Cybernetics and Systems;Article;Scopus;10.1080/01969722.2022.2122014;;;Yes;;This study intends to predict the secondary school students’ academic achievements using machine learning methods, to determine the features that have the greatest influence on achievement, and to develop a system for the prediction of academic achievement. In line with this objective, the prediction of year-end weighted grade point averages using secondary school students’ socioeconomic, demographic characteristics, and course grade data is addressed as a classification problem. The data set used in the present study was collected from students studying at a secondary school in Istanbul province of Turkey. With the purpose of classification of the target variable, 7 machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes were applied, and their performances were compared. According to the results of the model performance evaluation, it becomes clear that the most successful model was the Random Forest algorithm (accuracy: 80.73%).

The features of the students’ academic background (grade point average of past years, Turkish course 1st-semester average, and Math 1st-semester average) were found as the features that most affect achievement. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
Board 187: A Hybrid Community of Practice Model to Prepare Pre-Service STEM Teachers to Teach Engineering;Chesnutt B.;2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In recent years, engineering has been increasingly incorporated into K-12 classrooms, even though K-12 teachers commonly have no prior experience with engineering or training in how to teach engineering. Therefore, schools cannot scale their programs to meet the criteria needed to teach engineering effectively. As a result, many teachers hold common misconceptions about what engineers do and have low self-efficacy with teaching engineering, leading to a lack of interest in engineering among K-12 students. Research indicates that students tend to hold stereotypical and narrow perceptions of engineering, which in turn limits their interest in engineering as a future career choice. Previous research indicates that to improve engineering literacy in the United States and support the professional formation of engineers, there is a critical need to provide engineering education training to pre-service teachers, especially those mathematics and science teachers who are most likely to be teaching standalone engineering courses and other related courses where engineering practices can be most effectively integrated into the curriculum. However, there are currently very few colleges of education that provide any training to prepare pre-service teachers to teach engineering. In this study, pre-service teachers and engineering undergraduate students worked together to learn about engineering education and develop engineering-focused activities for use in K-12 classrooms. A new course model was created that utilized a hybrid community of practice where students learned about engineering education and worked together to support local K-12 schools by engaging in service learning. This project explored the ways in which participation in this course impacted pre-service teachers' perceptions of engineering and engineering teaching self-efficacy. We first administered a survey designed to measure engineering teaching self-efficacy to pre-service teachers at the beginning and end of the course. In addition, pre-service teachers also completed reflective journals throughout the course in which they were asked to reflect on how specific aspects of the course impacted their understanding of the nature of engineering and their confidence in their ability to teach engineering. They were also asked to reflect on their confidence in their ability to teach engineering in the future and on how their perceptions of engineering and self-efficacy had changed after participating in the course. All reflective journals were analyzed qualitatively using an open coding method to identify common themes in the responses. The quantitative survey results demonstrated that the engineering teaching self-efficacy of pre-service teachers increased after participating in this course. Furthermore, in reflective journals, students indicated that they felt more confident in their ability to teach engineering by the end of the course, with many saying that they now had a better understanding of engineering as a field and how to teach it than they had before. Participants also stated that they felt like more exposure to engineering and training on how to teach engineering would further increase their self-efficacy and willingness to teach engineering in K-12. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024.
An Al-BERT-Bi-GRU-LDA algorithm for negative sentiment analysis on Bilibili comments;"Liang Z.; Chen J.";2024;PeerJ Computer Science;Article;Scopus;10.7717/PEERJ-CS.2029;;;Yes;Yes;The number of online self-learning users has been increasing due to the promotion of various lifelong learning programs. Unstructured commentary text related to their real learning experience regarding the learning process is generally published by users to show their opinions and complaints. The article aims to utilize the dataset of real text comments of 10 high school mathematics courses participated by high school students in the Bilibili platform and construct a hybrid algorithm called the Artificial Intelligence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) + Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to crunch data and extract their sentiments. A series of tests regarding algorithm comparison were conducted on the educational review datasets. Comparative analysis found that the proposed algorithm achieves higher precision and lower loss rates than other alternative algorithms. Meanwhile, the loss ratio of the proposed algorithm was kept at a low level. At the topic mining level, the topic clustering of negative comments found that the barrage content was very messy and the complexity of the course content was generally Reported by the students.

Assessment of organizer model and conventional teaching method for improved student learning performance: a gamification-based perspective;"Serbaya S.H.; Rizwan A.; Sánchez-Chero M.; Mushtaq I.; Kaswan M.S.; Garza-Reyes J.A.";2024;TQM Journal;Article;Scopus;10.1108/TQM-08-2024-0322;;;Yes;;Purpose: The main objective of the study is to analyze the effectiveness of the advance organizer model (AOM) versus the conventional teaching method (CTM) in teaching high school math using game-based learning (GBL) for improved student learning performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 480 students, covering sociodemographics, educational identifiers and actions, were collected across two semesters. The research analyzed factors like interest, motivation, and problem-solving abilities to assess the impact of teaching methods. A quasi-experimental design, due to non-randomized group selection, was used, mitigating differences via analysis of covariance. Students were split into control and test groups, and test scores before and after administering the treatment were calculated. HypoThesis testing was carried out to find the effectiveness of AOM versus CTM. The sample contains a diverse sociodemographic background and educational setting. 175 students in the sample were female and 305 were male. The sample was made up of 14 nationalities, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Peru, Iraq and Lebanon. Parent participation was also incorporated through parental satisfaction surveys. Findings: Despite unknown group differences, the study found significant differences in Mean Retention Scores between the AOM and CTM groups. This suggests that AOM has considerable advantages in teaching mathematics over CTM. Originality/value: The study of the first kind that explores the effectiveness of different teaching methods based on gamification perspective for improving student performance. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Using random forest analysis to identify student demographic and high school-level factors that predict college engineering major choice;"Tan L.; Main J.B.; Darolia R.";2021;Journal of Engineering Education;Article;Scopus;10.1002/jee.20393;Yes;;Yes;Yes;"Background: Given the importance of engineers to a nation's economy and potential innovation, it is imperative to encourage more students to consider engineering as a college major. Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance. Purpose/HypoThesis: This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice. Design/Method: Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked. Results: Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school. Conclusions: Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering. © 2021 American Society for Engineering Education."
A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Teacher Practices in Supporting Student Learning and Engagement in an AI-Enabled Classroom;"Karumbaiah S.; Borchers C.; Shou T.; Falhs A.-C.; Liu P.; Nagashima T.; Rummel N.; Aleven V.";2023;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_37;;;Yes;;Research indicates that teachers play an active and important role in classrooms with AI tutors. Yet, our scientific understanding of the way teacher practices around AI tutors mediate student learning is far from complete. In this paper, we investigate spatiotemporal factors of student-teacher interactions by analyzing student engagement and learning with an AI tutor ahead of teacher visits (defined as episodes of a teacher being in close physical proximity to a student) and immediately following teacher visits. To conduct such integrated, temporal analysis around the moments when teachers visit students, we collect fine-grained, time-synchronized data on teacher positions in the physical classroom and student interactions with the AI tutor. Our case study in a K12 math classroom with a veteran math teacher provides some indications on factors that might affect a teacher’s decision to allocate their limited classroom time to their students and what effects these interactions have on students. For instance, teacher visits were associated more with students’ in-the-moment behavioral indicators (e.g., idleness) than a broader, static measure of student needs such as low prior knowledge. While teacher visits were often associated with positive changes in student behavior afterward (e.g., decreased idleness), there could be a potential mismatch between students visited by the teacher and who may have needed it more at that time (e.g., students who were disengaged for much longer). Overall, our findings indicate that teacher visits may yield immediate benefits for students but also that it is challenging for teachers to meet all needs – suggesting the need for better tool support. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
Enhancing the Admissions Process for Engineering Baccalaureate Programs: A Machine Learning Approach to Developing a Valid and Reliable Examination;"Ramos M.S.; Barajas J.R.B.; Gealone P.J.N.; Aspra N.O.; Padua O.M.; Lucero A.T.";2023;2023 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2023;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137793;;Yes;Yes;;This paper details an approach to identify multiple-choice questions that are most effective in discriminating deficiencies in mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students who are graduates of the K-12 program that was recently implemented in the Philippines. To achieve this objective, machine learning algorithms such as the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were implemented. From a question bank containing 1,300 questions covering Algebra (A), Advanced Algebra (AA), Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (T), Analytic Geometry (AG), and Solid Mensuration (SM), five domain experts identified the suitability of the questions as part of a diagnostic examination in mathematics. Specifically, using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being the highest), the experts rated the suitability of each question to test the proficiency of a student in 23 mathematics competencies based on what is prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The collected survey data were then used to train the machine learning models, which extracted patterns to identify the questions that would be most suitable to test the mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students. With a precision recall score of 99.90%, the LR model was selected as the best performing model and analysis of how the LR model predicts the labels through the use of shap values revealed that the preference was given towards questions which test student proficiency in foundational mathematics competencies like that of Algebra and Analytical Geometry. Overall, these findings provided a better understanding of the questions that are most effective in discriminating student deficiencies in mathematics subjects.  © 2023 IEEE.
Quantum Computing for High-School Students An Experience Report;"Angara P.P.; Stege U.; MacLean A.";2020;Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering, QCE 2020;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00047;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Quantum computing is an emerging field that can revolutionize our ability to solve problems and enable breakthroughs in many areas including optimization, machine learning, chemistry, and drug design. With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the abovementioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed 'unplugged' activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter noteBooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university. © 2020 IEEE.
Multi-models of educational data mining for predicting student performance in mathematics: A case study on high schools in cambodia;"Sokkhey P.; Navy S.; Tong L.; Okazaki T.";2020;IEIE Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing;Article;Scopus;10.5573/IEIESPC.2020.9.3.185;;;Yes;;Education is crucial for the development of any country. Analysis of education datasets requires effective algorithms to extract hidden information and gain the fruitful results to improve academic performance. Multiple models were used to maximize the contribution to the education environment. In this study, we used the spot-checking algorithm to compare these methods and find the most effective method. We propose three main classes of education research tools: A statistical analysis method, machine learning algorithms, and a deep learning framework. The data were obtained from many high schools in Cambodia. We introduced feature selection techniques to figure out the informative features that affect the future performance of students in mathematics. The proposed ensemble methods of tree-based classifiers provide satisfiying results, and in that, random forest algorithm generates the highest accuracy and the lowest predictive mean squared error, thus showing potential in this prediction and classification problem. The results from this work can be used as recipe and recommendation for mining various material settings in improving high school student performance in Cambodia. © 2020 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers.

Dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system used in agent-based intelligent tutoring system;"Khosravifar B.; Cuevas C.; Bentahar J.";2018;2018 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing, CSCE 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2018;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Peer-to-peer tutoring in high schools are increasingly used to model a dynamic learning environment where students can effectively teach and learn by improving self-regulatory skills. We propose a dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system in the form of a mathematical framework for a recommender system that addresses the problem of formulating response phrases for the tutoring considering the underlying sequence of possible phrases. Ultimately, using the recommended phrases, the peer tutor becomes more professional in teaching math problems to peer students. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it is adaptive to the peer student’s concentration level and accordingly recommends phrases to the peer tutor while considering the sequence of communication took place in the session combined with the reflection on peer student’s concentration level. Improving the quality of education via peer-to-peer training has been a challenge for a while and in this paper, we attempt to address the problem by using AI techniques to generate phrases in the form of recommendations to the students who tutor peers having difficulty with similar problems. We propose a recommender sequence mapping system to effectively recommend new phrases that are meaningful and goal-oriented given the past sequence of communication. Evaluation of the approach on the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves shows that the proposed recommender system is highly robust and accurately learns parameters in various settings. Given that there is no system to be used as benchmark, we managed to compare the system with and without deployment of the Al-empowered recommender framework and discuss the system performance in various aspects.

An intelligent tutoring system and teacher dashboard to support mathematizing during science inquiry;Dickler R.;2019;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-23207-8_61;;;Yes;;Using mathematics is critical to science inquiry at the high school level and is predictive of students’ later success in STEM college majors and careers. Inq-ITS (Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System) has recently added mathematizing functionalities in order to support students in the mathematical practices needed for scientific inquiry, and our teacher alerting dashboard, Inq-Blotter, is being extended to alert teachers in real-time to students’ difficulties with this practice. Mathematizing in science can be challenging as students must attend to multiple sources of information (i.e., graphs, data tables), as well as do graphing and modeling. In the present paper, I describe three studies on the use of Inq-Blotter to support students on mathematizing in which I: (1) explore students’ eye-movements and think-aloud protocols while mathematizing in Inq-ITS to identify the proportion of mathematizing difficulties that are related to knowledge acquisition processes versus other mathematical competencies (e.g., graph building and modeling), (2) examine if alerts within Inq-Blotter permit teachers to identify students who need help most (relative to teachers without access to alerts), and (3) identify whether teacher support based on alerts leads to improvements on students’ next opportunity to engage in mathematizing and examine the corresponding teacher discourse associated with students’ gains. These studies will indicate how to support students on mathematizing with intelligent technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.
Developing computational thinking teaching strategies to model pandemics and containment measures;"Araya R.; Isoda M.; Moris J.M.";2021;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;Article;Scopus;10.3390/ijerph182312520;;;Yes;;COVID-19 has been extremely difficult to control. The lack of understanding of key as-pects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incor-porate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technol-ogy, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families. © 2021 by the authors.

Informally Teaching Black Youth STEM Concepts Virtually Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning;"Lamkin D.; Ghosh R.; Asino T.I.; Kwembe T.A.";2021;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-80129-8_32;;;Yes;;There have been great efforts to advance STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines and address the need for diversity in the STEM field. It is critical for significant economic prosperity to increase the number of STEM programs for youth. Researchers have examined the STEM fields racial and gender disparities because it is equally essential to have STEM workers from all racial/ethnic backgrounds and genders to influence the STEM pipeline. Many U.S. schools work to integrate more STEM-based curriculum in efforts to make improvements in education and career exploration. This has included restructuring educational standards and creating specific STEM programs throughout various communities. Students rely on technology every day without training about the connected career opportunities. To better prepare students to fill roles in the STEM workforce, there is a need to help students understand the connection between their secondary math and science coursework and STEM occupations. Since there tends to be a gap between education and career exploration, this study uses the foundational principles of the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) to focus on behaviors and youth influences to explore the capacity of youth participants to influence their career exploration and perception towards STEM using the Mark Patrick Mahoney Attitudes and Perceptions towards STEM (APT) survey. The Black Youth participants will explore the engineering and technology within the STEM acronym and learn computer science’s specific career field, emphasizing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, and app development using MIT App Inventor. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

A multimodal platform to teach mathematics to students with vision-impairment;"Jariwala A.; Marghitu D.; Chapman R.";2021;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-78095-1_10;;;Yes;;The advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the last decade have led many developers, universities, and researchers to invest in the research and development of digital teaching platforms. This paper compares existing features implemented in the first prototype and provides visually impaired high-school students with a system to learn and practice mathematical problems. This project describes possibilities provided by open-source APIs such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and shows how to implement them to make education universal and accessible. We aim to achieve this by introducing an open-source platform, which will provide a set of modules for personalized speech recognition and accessible online tutoring. The system is divided into two modules: First, an intelligent conversational agent to help students learn new mathematical concepts, which opens up possibilities of providing students with a personalized response. Second, a mathematical expression parser and evaluator to help the student practice mathematical questions.

Towards Explainable Student Group Collaboration Assessment Models Using Temporal Representations of Individual Student Roles;"Som A.; Kim S.; Lopez-Prado B.; Dhamija S.; Alozie N.; Tamrakar A.";2021;Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, EDM 2021;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Collaboration is identified as a required and necessary skill for students to be successful in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). However, due to growing student population and limited teaching staff it is difficult for teachers to provide constructive feedback and instill collaborative skills using instructional methods. Development of simple and easily explainable machine-learning-based automated systems can help address this problem. Improving upon our previous work, in this paper we propose using simple temporal-CNN deep-learning models to assess student group collaboration that take in temporal representations of individual student roles as input. We check the applicability of dynamically changing feature representations for student group collaboration assessment and how they impact the overall performance. We also use Grad-CAM visualizations to better understand and interpret the important temporal indices that led to the deep-learning model’s decision. © EDM 2021.All rights reserved.
Modeling Engagement in Self-Directed Learning Systems Using Principal Component Analysis;"Hershcovits H.; Vilenchik D.; Gal K.";2020;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;Article;Scopus;10.1109/TLT.2019.2922902;;;Yes;;This paper studies students engagement in e-learning environments in which students work independently and solve problems without external supervision. We propose a new method to infer engagement patterns of users in such self-directed environments. We view engagement as a continuous process in time, measured along chosen axes that are derived from student data in the system using unsupervised learning (Principal Component Analysis). We construct a trajectory of user activity by projecting the user's scores along the selected PCs at regular time intervals. This approach is applied to a popular e-learning software for K12 math education that is used by thousands of students worldwide. We identify cohorts of users according to the way their trajectory changes over time (e.g., monotone up, monotone down, and constant). Each of the cohorts exhibits distinct behavioral dynamics and differed substantially in the amount of time users spent in the e-learning system. Specifically, one cohort included students that dropped out of the system after choosing very difficult problems that they were not able to complete, while another cohort included students users that chose more diverse problems and stayed longer in the system. In future work, these results can be used by teachers or intelligent tutors to track students' engagement in the system and decide whether and how to intervene. © 2008-2011 IEEE.
Graphic Model of Virtual Teaching Supervision through Fuzzy Logic in Non-University Educational Centers;"Falla-Falcón N.; López-Meneses E.; Ramírez-Fernández M.-B.; Vázquez-Cano E.";2022;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;Article;Scopus;10.3390/ijerph192416533;;;Yes;;This research analyzes the supervision of non-university virtual training due to the unexpected non-face-to-face teaching scenario caused by COVID-19 with a graphic model using the SULODITOOL® instrument. It arises as a research line of the Chair of Education and Emerging Technologies, Gamification and Artificial Intelligence of the Pablo de Olavide University (Seville) and is developed under the auspices of other assessment instruments within the framework of the functions and attributions of the Education Inspectorate of Spain. The aforementioned instrument is made up of 10 weighted supervisory indicators using fuzzy logic. The aggregation of linguistic variables of 242 expert judges was performed using the probabilistic OR function and defuzzified using the area centroid method to calculate the aforementioned weights. Based on the innovative analytical and graphic methodology used to analyze the supervision of virtual teaching, both synchronous and asynchronous, it stands out from the results obtained that there are certain supervision indicators, such as the training design and the methodology used, which should be considered as factors key in all the scenarios studied (primary education, compulsory secondary education and post-compulsory education). © 2022 by the authors.
An important component to investigating STEM persistence: the development and validation of the science identity (SciID) scale;"Lockhart M.E.; Kwok O.-M.; Yoon M.; Wong R.";2022;International Journal of STEM Education;Article;Scopus;10.1186/s40594-022-00351-1;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Background: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) influence almost every aspect of our daily lives. However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. Science identity has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as Reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students’ science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results: Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach’s alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions: Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student’s standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students’ science identity. © 2022, The Author(s).

The positive effect of in-class clicker questions on later exams depends on initial student performance level but not question format;"Hubbard J.K.; Couch B.A.";2018;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2018.01.008;;;Yes;;Active learning strategies have been increasingly adopted in higher education across many science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines. Audience response systems, or clickers, are useful tools that allow instructors to incorporate active learning into large-enrollment courses. Clickers engage students during class and provide real-time feedback that can allow both students and the instructor to identify and correct misconceptions. Many instructors that implement clickers also implement peer instruction, where students vote individually, discuss the question with their peers, and then revote. While this strategy has been shown to improve conceptual understanding, the effects of specific factors, such as question format and student performance level, on learning gains remains unclear. We designed a study in which students in an introductory biology course engaged in clickers with peer discussion during class. We incorporated a treatment in which one section of the course answered a given clicker question in a multiple-choice (MC) format and another section of the same course answered the same question in a multiple-true-false (MTF) format. Students subsequently answered an isomorphic exam question 1–3 weeks later. We observed that both clicker question formats had similar effects on later exam performance. While clickers had an overall positive effect on student exam performance, we found that this effect was significantly greater in higher-performing students, with lower-performing students showing little-to-no benefit. We also found that the initial response rates within peer discussion groups influenced whether students changed to the correct answer. These findings demonstrate that students interact with and benefit from clicker questions in different ways and highlights the importance of considering how different students might be affected by active learning strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Logistic regression and Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBM) and tree-based algorithms were applied on combined data sources from community surveys, school master lists and school government Reports to perform feature importance and training of prediction models. Availability of clean water, toilets, hospitals, electricity, household goods, cellphone internet and safety in the communities were identified as important variables impacting the performance of schools. The two algorithms; LightGBM and Logistic regression, underlies the developed prediction models and empowered the models with high accuracy, stability, and easy interpretation as shown by the odd ratios and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. © 2019 IEEE."

A systematic review of the literature regarding socially assistive robots in pre-tertiary education;"Papadopoulos I.; Lazzarino R.; Miah S.; Weaver T.; Thomas B.; Koulouglioti C.";2020;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103924;;;Yes;Yes;With rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade, schools have increasingly employed innovative tools, intelligent applications and methods that are changing the education system with the aim of improving both user experience and learning gain in the classrooms. Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synThesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
A Preliminary Work on Visualization-based Education Tool for High School Machine Learning Education;"Reyes A.A.; Elkin C.; Niyaz Q.; Yang X.; Paheding S.; Devabhaktuni V.K.";2020;2020 9th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference, ISEC 2020;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/ISEC49744.2020.9280629;;;Yes;;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become one of the most recurrent topics nowadays, due to its many industrial applications and its wide range of research topics in academia. Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent sub-fields, the popularity of which is complemented with its high demand as a professional skill for different industries. In the last few years, teaching ML is thus increasingly common in different levels of education. However, the curricula implemented for several courses or programs to learn ML are not always appropriate for the backgrounds of students, particularly high school students, as programming and complex math experience are usually required to implement ML models and understand the potential of this field. For this reason, it is possible for students to have difficulties with the lack of experience required or expected and to have prior to learning ML topics. In addition, motivation can be affected, as the curriculum does not sufficiently engage the student in the learning process. In this work, we propose a visualization tool to introduce high school students to the ML field, which will be implemented using concepts of gamification and adapting the content of the curriculum without requiring exhaustive experience in programming or math.  © 2020 IEEE.
STEM4Girls-Workshop on Machine Learning;"Thurner V.; Sickendiek J.";2021;Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-68198-2_70;;;Yes;;Although female specialists in the STEM area are urgently needed in the work force, the percentage of women in STEM study programs in higher education is still rather low. One reason for this are gender-related stereotypes that still persist in many modern cultures, which associate STEM as being a “male” domain. To actively draw young women towards STEM and Computer Science, we design a workshop for girls in the age group of 10th grade in secondary education. This workshop introduces the girls to machine learning in the application context of fashion and shopping. We define both cognitive and affective learning objectives and corresponding observable outcomes that indicate whether the learning objectives were reached or not. Based on these learning objectives, we develop a didactic concept for our workshop, as well as a web application as a front end for the machine learning application. Finally, we execute a pilot run of our workshop, which we evaluate with respect to participant satisfaction and the achievement of the learning objectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
Towards explainable group formation by knowledge map based genetic algorithm;"Flanagan B.; Liang C.; Majumdar R.; Ogata H.";2021;Proceedings - IEEE 21st International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, ICALT 2021;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/ICALT52272.2021.00119;;;Yes;;In recent years, machine learning of increasing complexity is being applied to problems in education. However, there is an increasing call for transparency and understanding into how the results of complex models are derived, leading to explainable AI gaining attention. The application of machine learning to automated group formation for collaborative work from learning system logs and other data has been progressing. Building on previous research in this field, we propose a group formation method that is based on a combination of course knowledge structures, reading behavior, and assessment analysis to create optimal heterogenous and homogeneous working groups using a genetic algorithm. The characteristics of each group are presented for explanation as a visualized knowledge map showing the strengths and weaknesses of each group, and are in the structure form of curriculum. We also present a case study of applying the method to junior high school mathematics log data, and provide explanation in a visualized form of standardized curriculum of group characteristics that are often referenced for learning design by teachers.  © 2021 IEEE.

This was a Class Action Research implemented to 40 students at 7th grade of MTsN Batang Toru. The data collection techniques were carried out by observation and distribution of a questionnaire. The data analysis technique used the analysis of Miles and Huberman models with three stages, namely data reduction, data display, and drawing conclusions. This research used three cycles to obtain the desired results. The results of the observation during the learning process showed the observations of the first cycle in the first meeting, student activity was 34.82%, and that in the second meeting was 42.33%. Furthermore, the students' activeness in the second cycle of the first meeting was 51.5%, and that in the second meeting was 63.83%. The third cycle of the first meeting was 74.16%, at the second meeting was 85.16%. A questionnaire indicated that students' activeness during the first, second and third cycles were 44.16%, 64.16% and 84.33%, respectively. It can be concluded that the activeness of students in the line and angle topics in mathematics lessons using the concrete object demonstration method had increased as expected. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
A Machine Learning and Explainable AI Approach for Predicting Secondary School Student Performance;"Hasib K.M.; Rahman F.; Hasnat R.; Alam M.G.R.";2022;2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference, CCWC 2022;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720806;;;Yes;;An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school Reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working. © 2022 IEEE.

Automated Student Group Collaboration Assessment and Recommendation System Using Individual Role and Behavioral Cues;"Som A.; Kim S.; Lopez-Prado B.; Dhamija S.; Alozie N.; Tamrakar A.";2021;Frontiers in Computer Science;Article;Scopus;10.3389/fcomp.2021.728801;;;Yes;Yes;Early development of specific skills can help students succeed in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Different education standards consider “Collaboration” as a required and necessary skill that can help students excel in these fields. Instruction-based methods is the most common approach, adopted by teachers to instill collaborative skills. However, it is difficult for a single teacher to observe multiple student groups and provide constructive feedback to each student. With growing student population and limited teaching staff, this problem seems unlikely to go away. Development of machine-learning-based automated systems for student group collaboration assessment and feedback can help address this problem. Building upon our previous work, in this paper, we propose simple CNN deep-learning models that take in spatio-temporal representations of individual student roles and behavior annotations as input for group collaboration assessment. The trained classification models are further used to develop an automated recommendation system to provide individual-level or group-level feedback. The recommendation system suggests different roles each student in the group could have assumed that would facilitate better overall group collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a feedback system. We also list the different challenges faced when working with the annotation data and describe the approaches we used to address those challenges. © Copyright © 2021 Som, Kim, Lopez-Prado, Dhamija, Alozie and Tamrakar.
Particle Swarm Model for Predicting Student Performance in Computing Programs;"Nachouki M.; Mehdi R.A.K.";2022;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-82196-8_7;;;Yes;;Predicting student performance in computing majors and the factors affecting his success can have a substantial effect on improving student academic performance and his on-time graduation with all the financial benefits that come with that. There is a limited amount of time an academic advisor may allocate to each student to identify problem areas in the curriculum and take appropriate actions and advise the student based on informed judgement. Thus, there is a need to predict which students are at risk early on in the program. In this work, we have built a prediction model based on particle swarm optimization to estimate the final graduation grade point average (GPA) of students enrolled in the information technology program at Ajman University. Input predictors used in this work were Students' final GPA scores in core courses and high school average grade. Based on records of 74 students who have graduated from the program so far, we have found that the most influential predictor of graduation GPA is high school grade average. Our results showed that the Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics have no role to play in the prediction of GPA while networking and security courses have the most significant prediction contribution. Forty per cent of predicted values fall within 0.25 of the real GPA, which has a maximum upper bound of four. However, the accuracy of the model significantly improved when applied to a much larger publicly available dataset with 88% of GPA scores falling within 0.25 of the actual GPA. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Using gamification to persuade more women and minorities into STEM;Park J.;2019;Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;This Report looks at several educational design techniques used by Intergalactic Education LLC over the last three years to motivate more students into pursuing a STEM career, more specifically: underrepresented demographics, ages 11-14. The software platform tested during this study utilizes a compelling storyline, machine learning, and friendly competition to promote science, technology, engineering, and math within secondary school systems. This Report contains lessons learned from the pilot programs conducted by Intergalactic Education within the Charles County Maryland School District. During this period, three classes of 8th-grade honors algebra students were allowed access to a simulation game called Space World™. One of the teachers involved in the program was chosen by the Space Foundation to become a part of their selective Teacher Liaison Program cohort. This analysis also identified a number of shortcomings in existing education technology solutions. The research indicates that most digital instructional products do not have the high-fidelity graphics and animations that millennials have come to expect from applications they download on their handheld computers. Additionally, teachers and school administrators are not effectively leveraging big data collection that should be integrated into existing curriculum.

A review: Predicting student success at various levels of their learning journey in a science programme;"Khanyisa Mabunda J.G.; Jadhav A.; Ajoodha R.";2021;2021 IEEE International IOT, Electronics and Mechatronics Conference, IEMTRONICS 2021 - Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422519;;;Yes;;This paper examines how features affect student persistence or dropout at South African higher education institutions, based on three previous studies. In the previous studies, high school grades were used as a valid predictor of student success. The quality of a high school's learning environment has an effect on almost every aspect of higher education success. Students who are better prepared coming out of high school are ideally suited to do well in higher education institutions, who they are, how much money they have, and where they go don't matter. This review aims to identify effective features that warrant student success from high school grades and choice of academic courses during registration in higher education. The following questions are used to guide this review: How can we define student success? Which features should we focus on? Which models work? Based on data mining techniques such as machine learning models that the previous studies have used to predict student success, it has been revealed that the most important features that influence student success in a Computer Science programme are Prior Computer experience, Mathematics, English from High school and the choice of a course. © 2021 IEEE.
Automated Matching of Exercises with Knowledge components;"Tian Z.; Flanagan B.; Dai Y.; Ogata H.";2022;30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;;;;Yes;;As intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) fast develop, they have been implemented in many classrooms combing with various tutorial tools. Especially, matching exercises with knowledge components is the fundamental task of many applications, such as automatic recommendation, student knowledge tracing etc. However, manually labelling educational data is labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, a range of machine learning methods has been proposed to address this problem, while few of them focusing on Japanese educational dataset in the real high school. In this paper, we leverage natural language processing techniques with Keyphrase extraction methods based on Japanese math exercises. We evaluate the model performance with several state-of-the-art methods and how it works in a real educational task. The results show that our methods outperform several state-of-art methods and can effectively save time for managing math exercise. © 30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings.

The STEM education provides courses to educate students in four disciplines, i.e. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In addition, transforming current industry to a modern industry needs the support from a group of professional people who are familiar with the core technologies of ID 4.0, such as virtual and real Integration systems, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence(AI). Programming is the key to make the above industrial revolution success. Thus, our previous project developed a low cost humanoid robot as a learning tool applied in STEM programs. With the assistance of the humanoid robot, young students can learn programming courses easily and efficiently. Currently, STEM education is often applied in elementary, junior-high and senior-high schools. It really improves students' learning circumstance in STEM fields. This paper introduced the STEAM education model to create a good learning circumstance for art students. Digital teaching aids, such as humanoid robot, and quadruped mechanical animal, support students to learn STEM programs more intuitively. Those aids can help students to learn mechanical mechanisms, electronic motors, digital control and programming and so on. These teaching aids are all open source, and they can be printed by 3D printers. Students can learn mechanics, electronics, and programming via the course. In order to enable students to use the humanoid robot digital teaching aids more effectively and completely, a humanoid robot motion editor is developed. This editor was developed by python and VTK, and it also has a friendly window-based interface. Its main task is to provide students to edit the motion of the robots quickly and easily. Through this editor, students can learn more about multi-foot and humanoid robot motions.  © 2022 IEEE.
What would the matrix do?: a systematic review of K-12 AI learning contexts and learner-interface interactions;"Moore R.L.; Jiang S.; Abramowitz B.";2023;Journal of Research on Technology in Education;Article;Scopus;10.1080/15391523.2022.2148785;Yes;;Yes;Yes;This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence’s instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synThesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration. © 2022 ISTE.
DRONEscape: Designing an Educational Escape Room for Adult AI Literacy;"Dipaola D.; Shen J.; Hu R.; Alghowinem S.; Breazeal C.";2023;IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/CoG57401.2023.10333148;;Yes;Yes;;Escape rooms have become increasingly popular as a form of entertainment, in addition to being adopted by educators for their effectiveness in improving student engagement and learning. While they have been introduced in various educational contexts, from nursing to mathematics, and for different age groups, including K-12 and university students, little research has been conducted on the benefits of escape rooms for adult learning of artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, most escape room implementations lack relevance to real-world situations and challenges with using AI systems in the wild. This study explores the effectiveness of an escape room, DRONEscape, as a tool for teaching AI concepts to Air Force participants. The results suggest that escape rooms can most effectively facilitate engagement and collaboration, and have positive effects on learning AI concepts. This paper also provides considerations for improvements to future iterations of AI-themed escape rooms to enhance learning, collaboration, engagement, and enjoyment. © 2023 IEEE.
Equalizing Data Science Curriculum for Computer Science Pupils;"Mike K.; Hazan T.; Hazzan O.";2020;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3428029.3428045;;;Yes;;Data science is a new interdisciplinary field of research that focuses on extracting value from data. As an interdisciplinary science it integrates knowledge and methods from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data. As data science is still forming as a domain, several points of view exist on how to teach data science. The curriculum of many undergraduate data science programs includes advanced knowledge and skills in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and one or more data domains. Several initiatives for designing high school data science curricula have emerged recently. Since it is unrealistic to teach all the above-mentioned advanced topics at the high school level, the high school data science curriculum focuses on a broad understanding of the data science workflow rather than on mathematical and algorithmic details that characterize undergraduate programs. High school computer science pupils, however, are expected to have a deep understanding of algorithms, as algorithms are the heart of computer science. In this paper, we present our attempt to adapt a data science course to computer science high school pupils that incorporates both a broad view on data science and data workflow, as well as deep understanding of data processing algorithms and specifically, machine learning. This course is taught for 10th grade computer science pupils in an Israeli public school, and was also taught in a summer workshop for computer science teachers.  © 2020 ACM.
What’s a textBook? Envisioning the 21st century K-12 text;"Ritter S.; Fisher J.; Lewis A.; Finocchi S.B.; Hausmann R.G.M.; Fancsali S.E.";2019;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;We present a vision for 21st century digital textBooks, reflecting on Carnegie Learning’s experience as a K-12 curriculum and service provider. After briefly considering the purpose of a textBook, we introduce components of Carnegie Learning’s blended mathematics curricula and consider the inherent tension between providing personalized, individual learning while also providing opportunities for collaborative learning. We then describe a vision for an Adaptive Classroom Environment and a supporting Adaptive Learning Recommendation System to deliver improved learning outcomes based on 21st century digital technologies. While Carnegie Learning has proto-typed facets of both the Adaptive Classroom Environment and Adaptive Learning Recommendation System, this area is ripe for exciting contributions and progress from the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) and related communities of researchers, developers, and practitioners. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

An Approach to Oral English Assessment Based on Intelligent Computing Model;"Jing C.; Zhao X.; Ren H.; Chen X.; Gaowa N.";2022;Scientific Programming;Article;Scopus;10.1155/2022/4663574;;;Yes;Yes;"""English craze""has become a key topic of concern to the majority of the people. Apart from setting English as a compulsory course like Chinese and Mathematics in schools, various English training institutions outside the school are also emerging one after another. Due to the English teaching mode in class, dumb English appears. In recent years, with the popularity of virtual electronic devices, more and more researchers try to use virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive English learning environment. Oral English teaching is an important part of the whole English teaching. In the traditional English classroom teaching practice, teachers' pronunciation is not standard, and students are difficult to learn the correct pronunciation standard, which makes oral English very passive. The most important problem in oral English teaching is to improve students' interest in oral English, make students willing to speak and realize English communication. Oral English teaching is an important link in both primary and secondary schools and universities. Teachers are afraid of nonstandard pronunciation in limited classrooms, and they are afraid to speak and unwilling to speak, which leads to passive oral English teaching. Therefore, this paper will set up an intelligent computing model to evaluate and analyze spoken English in a standard and accurate way. Artificial intelligence speech synThesis and imitation of voice change are typical applications of decoupling representation learning in speech, the oral evaluation is based on the proposition that speech is a dynamic and complex process. With the help of the rapidly developed computer speech synThesis and imitation technology, an oral evaluation path based on speech synThesis and imitation is proposed, that is, oral evaluation is carried out by using the network parameters and output of deep learning of computer speech imitation.  © 2022 Caihong Jing et al."
E-learning and classroom learning activities;Jan?a?ík A.;2019;Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL;Conference paper;Scopus;10.34190/EEL.19.109;;;Yes;;Systems for e-learning or blended learning support of teaching have become an integral part of teaching process from primary schools to universities. There is an enormous number of various LMS systems and educational programmes. Most available systems offer teaching and learning materials and provide feedback to the teacher – information on results achieved by their students. The paper introduces the Techambition system and its potential and opportunities it provides. The system was designed to support mathematics education on upper secondary schools and has been developed by a British company of the same name. This system is used in mathematics education on dozens of upper secondary schools in the Czech Republic. The number of students who work with it exceeds 10,000. Last year Faculty of Education, Charlese University signed a contract with the company Techambition. Academic staff of Faculty of Education are involved in development of educational content. Unlike other product, the Techambition system offers a brand new function – planning teaching activities. A system of artificial intelligence evaluates students’ work and prepares a list of activities for them that the teacher should use in the next lesson. The plan includes both incentives for frontal teaching and proposals for collaborative learning. The system prepares for the teacher not only a set of tasks but also divides the students into groups. When dividing the students into groups, the system uses their characteristics (learning styles, knowledge of the topic, solving procedures used) with the aim of making the group work as effective as possible. Some activities are conducted on-line on computers and having evaluated the results new activities are proposed. The goal of the paper is to introduce the Techambition system as such, the method of designing individual activities as well as pupils’ and teachers’ experience with using the system. Results show that the use of AI in classroom management and lesson planning has a significant potential and deserves attention of further research. © The Authors, 2019. All Rights Reserved.
Apply machine learning algorithms to predict at-risk students to admission period;Embarak O.;2020;2020 7th International Conference on Information Technology Trends, ITT 2020;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/ITT51279.2020.9320878;;;Yes;;Educational organizations have a high burden of treating students with poor academic success (At-risk students). Many methods are pursued to help this group of pupils, such as psychological, a proper schedule for the vulnerable pupil, recall, personal training, mock-tests, private education by direct studies, or the success centers. However, these approaches are not enough to deal with the dilemma, since other variables are impacting the success of the learner, which may be their family problems, their cognitive style, Their previous academic accomplishment, the cornerstone of the college level. This paper explores the effect of pre-college academic accomplishments on the success of college students in the computer program. The pilot study predicts student academic success based on their math (EmSAT Math), English (EmSAT English), and High School Average (High School Average) knowledge and skills acquired by students before college entry. The study covers 120 students. After cleaning up the available data, we are left with 112 instances used to train machine learning models to predict learner performance in the computer program. The qualified models achieved a high precision of 90.5 percent (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest), while the Logistic Regression achieved a forecast accuracy of 78.1 percent. The main symptom for the student's academic status was the score in English, followed by the score in Math. The research has shown that the high school score is not the secret to predicting students with academic status at their college stage. © 2020 IEEE.

Teaching by induction: Project-based learning for silicon valley;"Jagannathan R.K.; Komives C.";2019;Journal of Engineering Education Transformations;Article;Scopus;10.16920/jeet/2019/v33i1/149003;;;Yes;;It is well known that there continues to be a shortage of women in technology jobs. The teaching methods and gender bias in K-12 education continue to favour boys progressing to engineering and technology positions. The project initiated by Ravi Krishnan Jagannathan in Silicon Valley, California, sought to prepare middle school and high school girls for success in high tech. The strategy used was to teach math and science inductively. The use of computers for teaching the girls both fundamental science and math in the middle school laid the foundation for teaching high school girls to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop solutions to current medical and ergonomic problems. This paper will discuss the inductive teaching strategy with the aim of motivating both parents and teachers to adopt a similar project that can help address the shortfall of women in tech.

Mechanistic Data Science for STEM Education and Applications;"Liu W.K.; Gan Z.; Fleming M.";2022;Mechanistic Data Science for STEM Education and Applications;Book;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-87832-0;;;Yes;;This Book introduces Mechanistic Data Science (MDS) as a structured methodology for combining data science tools with mathematical scientific principles (i.e., mechanistic principles) to solve intractable problems. Traditional data science methodologies require copious quantities of data to show a reliable pattern, but the amount of required data can be greatly reduced by considering the mathematical science principles. MDS is presented here in six easy-to-follow modules: 1) Multimodal data generation and collection, 2) extraction of mechanistic features, 3) knowledge-driven dimension reduction, 4) reduced order surrogate models, 5) deep learning for regression and classification, and 6) system and design. These data science and mechanistic analysis steps are presented in an intuitive manner that emphasizes practical concepts for solving engineering problems as well as real-life problems. This Book is written in a spectral style and is ideal as an entry level textBook for engineering and data science undergraduate and graduate students, practicing scientists and engineers, as well as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) high school students and teachers. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

An Effective Decision-Making Support for Student Academic Path Selection using Machine Learning;"Houngue P.; Hountondji M.; Dagba T.";2022;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;Article;Scopus;10.14569/IJACSA.2022.0131184;;;Yes;Yes;In Benin, after the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), learners can either enroll in a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), or further their studies in the general education. Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6th to 9th grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners’ ability and the stream. As a result, for learners’ ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners’ stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods. Furthermore, it provides a tool to ease students academic path selection, which may be used by educational institutes to ensure student performance. This paper presents the steps and the outputs of the study, we performed with some recommendations for future research. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Machine Learning (ML), as an integral subfield of AI, has become the new engine that revolutionizes practices of knowledge discovery. Making ML experience accessible to young learners, however, remains challenging due to its high demand for mathematical and computational skills. This research focuses on designing novel learning environments that help demystify ML technologies for K-12 students, and also investigating new opportunities for maximizing ML accessibility through integration with scientific discovery in STEM education. We developed SmileyCluster - a hands-on and collaborative learning environment that utilizes glyph-based data visualization and superposition comparative visualization to assist learning an entry-level ML technology, namely k-means clustering. Findings from an initial case study with high school students in a pre-college summer program show that SmileyCluster leads to positive change in learning ML concepts, methods and sense-making of patterns. Findings of this study also shed light on understanding ML as a data-enabled approach to support evidence-based scientific discovery in K-12 STEM education. © 2020 ACM.

Impact of implementing a long-term STEM-based active learning course on students’ motivation;"Julià C.; Antolí J.Ò.";2019;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;Article;Scopus;10.1007/s10798-018-9441-8;;;Yes;;This paper aims at analysing the effect of implementing a long-term STEM-based active learning course on students’ motivation. First of all, a course that introduces science, technology and engineering concepts to students was designed. The key point was to provide the students with authentic learning activities based on real-world problems. The students had to solve those problems working in 3-members group. The teacher’s role was as a learning guide. The course was implemented in a 6th grade class (primary education) and in a 7th grade class (secondary education) throughout a whole academic year. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was used to measure the students’ motivation in two different moments: at the end of the first term and at the end of the third term. The IMMS is based on the ARCS Model and measures four motivational factors: attention, relevance, confidence and satisfaction. The high scores obtained in the IMMS manifest that most students were motivated with the STEM course. Indeed, the highest scores were obtained in the questions corresponding to the satisfaction factor. Furthermore, results evidence that the level of motivation varied only slightly from the first to the third term test. Hence, we can affirm that the hands-on learning activities proposed during the STEM course allow to create a learning experience that interests and engages students. Finally, obtained results allow to know how the students feel about the new STEM course and to redesign it, if necessary, in order to improve the studied motivational factors. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.
Modeling COVID-19 disruptions via network mapping of the Common Core Mathematics Standards;"Huang L.; Bicol K.; Willcox K.E.";2023;Computers in Education Journal;Article;Scopus;;;;Yes;;This paper develops a mathematical and computational modeling approach that provides a data-driven platform to address research questions relating to student pathways in K-12 education. Specifically, this paper uses scalable network modeling to create a model of the Common Core Mathematics Standards. The result is an educational map that formally represents the Standards and the relationships among them. This educational map is represented mathematically as a network model that forms the basis for computational graph analytics and visualization to identify Standards and learning pathways of interest. Using the network model, we model the disruption due to COVID-19 related school closures in Spring 2020. Analysis on the network model enables identification of propagating effects of the closures on later grades and reveals pathways with potential high vulnerability. When combined with school-specific and/or student data, this model could provide valuable analytics support to decision makers. © 2023 American Society for Engineering Education. All rights reserved.
Intelligent system for interactive teaching through videogames;"Robles D.; Quintero M. C.G.";2020;Sustainability (Switzerland);Article;Scopus;10.3390/SU12093573;;;Yes;;Education, videogames, and intelligent systems are all relevant topics for researchers. Determining means of improving academic performance using a range of techniques and tools is an important challenge. However, while there are currently websites and multimedia resources that help students to improve their knowledge on specific topics, these lack in not having intelligent agents that can evaluate students and recommend materials to suit the difficulty that a user is having in a given subject. In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students' skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered. The results indicate that the implementation jointly of videogames and intelligent systems allows users to improve their performance in the given topics. © 2020 by the authors.

A double well on-line simulation and activities for active learning of introductory quantum mechanics;Faleti? S.;2020;European Journal of Physics;Article;Scopus;10.1088/1361-6404/ab90db;;;Yes;;Teaching introductory quantum mechanics is challenging, especially to students who have limited knowledge of mathematics. The challenges and approaches are evidenced in a wide range of literature. Our goal is to develop an active engagement module for introductory quantum mechanics that would cover the most important concepts: indeterminism, incompatibility, the difference between superposition and statistical mixture and the role of measurement. To accomplish this, we developed a free on-line simulation of a double well - a (pseudo) two-state system - which is able to evidence all of the above concepts. Students perform simulated experiments and build their knowledge from their observations. We present the simulation and the proposed experiments to address the above concepts. We provide a description of the activities and their outcomes as tested with high-school students in different settings. Qualitative analysis of learning outcomes offers evidence that between 60% and 100% of students can reach the following conclusions on their own. (i) The particle is only ever detected in one of the possible states. (ii) The outcome of one experiment cannot be predicted, only its probability can be predicted. (iii) For some pairs of quantities, knowing the value of one quantity exactly precludes the possibility of knowing the value of the other quantity exactly. (iv) A statistical mixture (of eigenstates) is not the same as a superposition state. (v) The measurement affects the time evolution of the system. The most difficult conclusion for students to reach is how exactly the measurement affects the system. The success rates presented here lead us to conclude that the simulated experiments can be very useful when designing an active engagement course on the concepts of quantum mechanics. While the development is done in high-school, we believe the results are also relevant for introductory university level, especially for non-physics students. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.
Toward learning progression analytics — Developing learning environments for the automated analysis of learning using evidence centered design;"Kubsch M.; Czinczel B.; Lossjew J.; Wyrwich T.; Bednorz D.; Bernholt S.; Fiedler D.; Strauß S.; Cress U.; Drachsler H.; Neumann K.; Rummel N.";2022;Frontiers in Education;Article;Scopus;10.3389/feduc.2022.981910;;;Yes;;National educational standards stress the importance of science and mathematics learning for today’s students. However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students’ needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students’ individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students’ science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both – meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students’ learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students’ learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students’ learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students’ learning – the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.

Teachers' Perceptions of Barriers Influencing African American and Hispanic Students with Disabilities' Participation in K-12 Computer Science Education;"Ashford-Hanserd S.; Singh S.; Muoneke A.; Eaglin P.";2021;2021 Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology, RESPECT 2021 - Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620628;;Yes;Yes;Yes;The Students with Disabilities in Computer Science (SWDCS) Research Alliance is conducting an NSF-funded study on teachers' perceptions about the barriers to increasing computer science (CS) awareness among African American and Hispanic students with disabilities (SWD). The SWDCS Research Alliance is a research-practitioner partnership of computer science and special educators. The purpose of this preliminary study is to increase African American and Hispanic students with disabilities' interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, and persistence in CS and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers. This project employs a project-based voice user interface (VUI) and artificial intelligence (AI) instruction, and tech mentoring. Of the 21 teachers participating in the Alliance, the research team identified a convenience sample of eight teachers to participate in semi-structured, focus group interviews. Using an inductive thematic analysis approach, the researchers identified the following emergent themes: limitations of school or administrative policies for African American and Hispanic SWD enrolling in CS classes, lack of CS-focused interventions for African American and Hispanic SWD, lack of formal teacher preparation for CS teachers to work with SWD, and structural barriers limiting SWD, Hispanic, and Black students' enrollment in CS classes. This study fills the gap in the literature concerning minority SWD's experiences in CS education. © 2021 IEEE.
Interdisciplinary K-12 Control Education in Biomedical and Public Health Applications;"Duncan D.; Garner R.; Bennett A.; Sinclair M.; Ramirez-De La Cruz G.; Pasik-Duncan B.";2022;IFAC-PapersOnLine;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.286;;;Yes;Yes;There is a lack of control education at the K-12 level, and introducing high school students to the wide range of control applications and methods needed for these problems will increase the number of students who later plan to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and control research or careers. Through our established partnerships with schools in California and Kansas, we have developed educational tools to positively influence the learning and career paths of young high school (HS) students from underserved districts and underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Through the development of new curricula, teaching modules, and shared resources that are made broadly available to other school districts, this work has the potential to impact a large number of K-12 teachers and students. We have been working to train HS teachers to create connections between the STEM subjects they teach students with advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that are often taught only post-HS. It creates a context where students can see how their STEM skills can be applied and a pathway of continuing STEM education from secondary to post-secondary. As a result, there is the potential to improve student interest and self-efficacy in STEM and to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Furthermore, AI is key to understanding and making use of data and solving many control problems. We aim to help students learn the fundamentals of how AI algorithms are applied in contemporary neuroscience. © 2022 The Authors.
DIDACTIC ACTIVITIES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE PERSPECTIVE OF STEM TEACHERS;"Fissore C.; Floris F.; Marchisio M.; Sacchet M.";2022;Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) might seem something very distant from the world of schools: a theme that is far from today's reality, especially when the education and training system is committed to tackling the problems associated with the pandemic situation. However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme ""Mathematics and AI"" which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

History of Logo;"Solomon C.; Harvey B.; Kahn K.; Lieberman H.; Miller M.L.; Minsky M.; Papert A.; Silverman B.";2020;Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages;Article;Scopus;10.1145/3386329;;;Yes;Yes;Logo is more than a programming language. It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first computer language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN). Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables. Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in the Logo language development as it encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices. © 2020 Owner/Author.
LiveHint: Intelligent digital support for analog learning experiences;"Fisher J.D.; Fancsali S.E.; Lewis A.J.; Fisher V.A.; Hausmann R.G.M.; Pavelko M.; Finocchi S.B.; Ritter S.";2020;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Among the critical expectations that learning stakeholders have for K-12 curriculum providers during the current global pandemic are that they provide: (a) support to rectify students' learning loss, (b) resources to help parents support student learning, and (c) greater access to open educational resources. We introduce a mobile-friendly, digital support for analog learning experiences called LiveHint, which currently supports students as they work on assignments in Carnegie Learning’s physical worktexts via a chatbot with access to thousands of context-sensitive hints. In addition to expanding the number of courses supported by LiveHint, we discuss possibilities for expanding the scope of activities supported by LiveHint within Carnegie Learning’s existing content. We also lay out possibilities for expanding the approach beyond Carnegie Learning’s content to teacher-created artifacts (e.g., custom worksheets), hand-offs between instructional modalities, and potential research use-cases for data collected from such a platform.

Student Low Achievement Prediction;"Zanellati A.; Zingaro S.P.; Gabbrielli M.";2022;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5_76;;;Yes;;In this paper, we propose a method for assessing the risk of low achievement in primary and secondary school. We train three machine learning models with data collected by the Italian Ministry of Education through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests. We compare the results of the trained models and evaluate the effectiveness of the solutions in terms of performance and interpretability. We test our methods on data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
AI-Infused Collaborative Inquiry in Upper Elementary School: A Game-Based Learning Approach;"Lee S.; Mott B.; Ottenbreit-Leftwich A.; Scribner A.; Taylor S.; Park K.; Rowe J.; Glazewski K.; Hmelo-Silver C.E.; Lester J.";2021;35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2021;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17836;;;Yes;;Artificial intelligence has emerged as a technology that is profoundly reshaping society and enabling rapid improvements in science, engineering, and mathematics, as well as information technology itself. This has generated increased demand for fostering an AI-literate populace as well as a growing recognition of the importance of promoting K-12 students' awareness and interest in AI. Although efforts are beginning to incorporate AI learning within K-12 education, there is little research exploring how to introduce students to AI and how to support teachers to integrate AI learning experiences in their classrooms. This is especially true at the elementary school level. A particularly promising approach for providing effective and engaging AI learning experiences for elementary students is game-based learning. In this paper, we explore how to introduce AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning into upper elementary school (student ages 8 to 11) using game-based learning. To ground the work in the realities of elementary school classrooms, we present insights from interviews with elementary school teachers to understand how best to support them in integrating AI into their classrooms. We then present the design of PRIMARYAI, a game-based learning environment that supports rich problem-based learning activities within upper elementary classrooms centered on AI applied toward solving life-science problems. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning to upper elementary students.

Development and Application of an Intelligent Assessment System for Mathematics Learning Strategy among High School Students—Take Jianzha County as an Example;"Wang G.; Chen X.; Zhang D.; Kang Y.; Wang F.; Su M.";2022;Sustainability (Switzerland);Article;Scopus;10.3390/su141912265;;;Yes;;"To improve the quality of mathematics learning for high school students in economically disadvantaged areas, and promote education equity and sustainable development, this study developed the Mathematics Learning Strategies Intelligent Assessment and Strategy Implementation System by using artificial intelligence technology. The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants’ diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system’s effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students’ mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective. © 2022 by the authors."

Novices’ conceptions of machine learning;"Mühling A.; Große-Bölting G.";2023;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100142;;;Yes;;With machine learning becoming more and more prevalent in society, it also becomes a topic that is relevant for general K12 education. At the same time, modern machine learning is relying heavily on mathematics, requiring novel approaches to teaching it in settings where a full coverage is not possible. In this context the study presented here investigates the conceptions that students have about the workings of a particular type of machine learning system before and after a short workshop. Students (N = 57) gave open ended answers that were analyzed qualitatively, following the approach of phenomenography. The resulting model was then validated with semi-structured interviews with teachers (N = 5). The results indicate that students’ mental models of the machine learning system changes during the workshop and that students initially hold a variety of conceptions that can be structured along two facets (“internal model” and “learning process”). Some of these conceptions are useful for learning, while others may present an obstacle - an information that is relevant for designing teaching about machine learning in the context of general education. © 2023 The Authors
Construction of teacher-student interaction evaluation index system for high school mathematics concept assimilation learning based on artificial intelligence;"Zhen Y.; Shi S.; Wang W.; Wang G.";2022;Artificial Intelligence in Education and Teaching Assessment;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1007/978-981-16-6502-8_13;;;Yes;;Teacher-student interaction is one of the most critical teaching behaviors in high school mathematics classrooms. As one of the main parts of mathematics teaching, concepts are the core of mathematics knowledge. Moreover, concept assimilation is the essential learning approach for senior students to acquire mathematics concepts. Therefore, this study constructed the Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning. Combining both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, this study first constructed the evaluation system from the theoretical perspective using the Delphi method. Then, the video analysis was used to verify the evaluation system by conducting a qualitative analysis of high-quality teaching videos from the practical perspective with the help of artificial intelligence. Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning constructed in this study included four first-level indicators: teacher-student interaction in the concept recognition stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept processing stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept reinforcement stage, and teacher-student interaction in the concept application stage, and eight second-level indicators: mutual communication, mobilizing learning initiative, explanation and exploration, inspired focus, example analysis, inspiration and concentration, task solving, and encouragement and feedback. This study could provide quantitative evaluation tools and theoretical models for teacher-student interaction in concept assimilation learning, and enrich teachers' understanding of concept teaching theory and teacher-student interaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.

Analyzing the Equity of the Brazilian National High School Exam by Validating the Item Response Theory’s Invariance;"Guardieiro V.; Raimundo M.M.; Poco J.";2022;Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Educational Data Mining, EDM 2022;Conference paper;Scopus;10.5281/zenodo.6852946;;;Yes;;Several studies adopt different approaches to examining how economic, racial, and gender circumstances influence student performance in large-scale entrance exams, such as the National High School Exam (ENEM). Using a methodology based on Item Response Theory, ENEM’s exam attempts to assess, for each item (question), the curve (function) that relates the participants’ abilities to their probabilities of correctly answering the item, which is assumed to hold whichever subgroup, a fundamental premise of IRT called invariance. This work analyzes whether the ENEM 2019 test presented similar curves for subpopulations defined by gender, race, and income, regardless of the participant’s actual abilities. Our approach is to analyze the properties of the observed curve for each group and then perform a nonparametric ranking test to compare the equity of each item (question) for each analyzed characteristic. We found that the”Languages and Codes” questions consistently favored male, white, and high-income participants. At the same time, the other three sets of questions (Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Human Sciences) were considerably more egalitarian. © 2022 Copyright is held by the author(s).
Effect of Immediate Feedback on Math Achievement at the High School Level;"Razzaq R.; Ostrow K.S.; Heffernan N.T.";2020;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-52240-7_48;;;Yes;;We examine the use of computer-based learning in the classroom and the effect of immediate feedback on student performance. Since it is well known in educational research that it is possible to observe a “Matthew Effect” in which the rich get richer, we wanted to see if feedback was useful for low prior knowledge students, as defined by students whose pretest score was at or below the median. In this counterbalanced randomized controlled trial, 243 tenth and eleventh grade mathematics students were exposed to one of two conditions, as we measured their learning from: 1) immediate feedback (where the computer told them correctness and they could also ask for hints) or 2) practice only (where they received feedback only after taking a posttest). Results suggest that immediate feedback from computer-based learning tasks benefit both high and low prior knowledge students, with low prior knowledge students exhibiting greater gains. The implications of these findings support further investigation into the use of computer-based learning tasks that provide immediate feedback. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Modeling Unstructured Data: Teachers as Learners and Designers of Technology-enhanced Artificial Intelligence Curriculum;"Tatar C.; Yoder M.M.; Coven M.; Wiedemann K.; Chao J.; Finzer W.; Jiang S.; Rosé C.P.";2021;Proceedings of International Conference of the Learning Sciences, ICLS ;Conference;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In this paper, we present a co-design study with teachers to contribute towards development of a technology-enhanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) curriculum, focusing on modeling unstructured data. We created an initial design of a learning activity prototype and explored ways to incorporate the design into high school classes. Specifically, teachers explored text classification models with the prototype and reflected on the exploration as a user, learner, and teacher. They provided insights about learning opportunities in the activity and feedback for integrating it into their teaching. Findings from qualitative analysis demonstrate that exploring text classification models provided an accessible and comprehensive approach for integrated learning of mathematics, language arts, and computing with the potential of supporting the understanding of core AI concepts including identifying structure within unstructured data and reasoning about the roles of human insight in developing AI technologies. © ISLS.

Machine learning for high school students;"Mariescu-Istodor R.; Jormanainen I.";2019;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1145/3364510.3364520;;;Yes;;In this study, we developed a machine learning method for object recognition that can be implemented using knowledge that high school students attain during their normal math and IT classes. We then tailored a two-hour interactive lesson in which the students were divided into groups to implement solutions to six distinct problems required by the method. The solutions were later put together by the teacher into a working web application (HTML + JavaScript). The lesson was taught on three occasions in Romanian schools to students between 13 and 19 years old. The students were excited about the lesson, and the collected data measuring students' intrinsic motivation suggests that the given tasks and the type of instruction were motivating them. The students also found the lesson achievable regardless the level of their previous programming background. The students were even able to suggest viable improvements to the method. The lesson is presented in short in this (17 minute) YouTube video1. Furthermore, we utilized the developed machine learning tool in a workshop with primary school children.

Complexity is the New Normality, Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Data-driven approaches have received a lot of attention recently from higher education researchers and policy-makers as well. At the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, we aim to extract insight from big data stored in the educational administration system in the framework of a project carried out in the cooperation of Central Academic Office and Institute of Mathematics. Among many other questions, we studied curriculum prerequisite networks with a student flow approach, the effect of mathematical remediation, the impact of living on-campus on academic achievement, the connection between grade inflation and student evaluation of teaching and efficient visualization of student flows. However, one of the most burning problems in higher STEM education all over the world is dropping out. In this paper, we present a predictive analytical approach for early detection of students at-risk of academic failure. We achieved relatively high accuracy, compared to the results of related works, which makes it suitable to deploy as a decision support system. We also present a web application that is able to identify at-risk students mainly based on their high school grades and matura scores using machine learning algorithms (e.g. XGBoost). The application can also be used to recommend tutoring sessions and remedial courses for at-risk students. Based on SHAP values, the application is also capable of making suggestions for students which skills to improve in order to succeed in their university studies. Besides Hungarian education system, our proposed methodology is also applicable to other educational environments all over the world. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

The Synergistic Effects of Self-Regulation Tools and the Flipped Classroom;Butzler K.B.;2016;Computers in the Schools;Article;Scopus;10.1080/07380569.2016.1137179;;;Yes;;Students at open-enrollment institutions enter college with a wide range of academic preparedness and are often required to take developmental classes to increase their academic skills to be successful in higher education. Further, few students possess self-regulated learning skills to aid in their learning. Researchers posited that academically at-risk students benefit from gains in self-regulated learning skills when a modeling and scaffolding approach is used to implement self-regulated learning tools. Self-regulated skills coupled with an active learning environment like the flipped classroom provide positive synergistic effects for academically at-risk students. This study compared several iterations of the flipped classroom in a general chemistry class at an open-enrollment college where high school class rank and mathematics placement level varied significantly. The results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that mathematics level and class rank were significant when predicting overall course grade regardless of the learning environment. The results of a paired-samples t test did not reveal a significant difference upon addition of note-taking and exam wrappers in a flipped classroom learning environment. However, students graduating high school in the top third, middle third, and bottom third of their graduating class increased their overall course grades in a flipped classroom using self-regulated tools by 7%, 3%, and 6%, respectively. To enhance the quantitative results, the author provides student comments on note-taking and the use of exam wrappers. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
Making STEM REAL: Real, experiential, active learning: An authentic interdisciplinary connection between the “schoolshed” and the watershed;"Levin D.; Dickerson D.";2015;Marine Technology Society Journal;Article;Scopus;10.4031/MTSJ.49.4.18;;;Yes;;K-12 educators from Maryland’s Eastern Shore traveled from the Chester River headwaters to the Chesapeake Bay aboard a research vessel analyzing sediment samples and using sonar to image its bottom and, incidentally, an 18th century shipwreck. Educators engaged in 10 Professional Development Modules where they participated in activities such as building observation buoys that collect water quality data and designing, building, and operating underwater robots. Additional program components included issues investigation, agro-ecology, bird identification, weather, and hands-on instruction to integrate the material into impact classroom content. The program strength lies in the cumulative knowledge gained by completing all of the components to get a holistic view of watershed exploration from the headwaters to the Bay. Consequently, the thread for this program is that all educators are from schools within the Chester River Watershed, herein termed a schoolshed. Data were plotted on a school-available website and are further supported by http://www.crwo.org. Shared resources were available for all of the teachers and delivered on demand so that the lessons could be implemented with classes on their school grounds. Independently contracted program evaluations were positive. All of the program’s components are easily adapted to other watersheds and are presently being repackaged as the Canyons to the Oceans program for the Oxnard California School District as the Coastal California Watershed Observatory. Since 2013, the program has been supported by the Maryland State Department of Education and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. © 2015, Marine Technology Society Inc.

Automated Theorem Proving in GeoGebra: Current Achievements;"Botana F.; Hohenwarter M.; Jani?i? P.; Kovács Z.; Petrovi? I.; Recio T.; Weitzhofer S.";2015;Journal of Automated Reasoning;Article;Scopus;10.1007/s10817-015-9326-4;;;Yes;;GeoGebra is an open-source educational mathematics software tool, with millions of users worldwide. It has a number of features (integration of computer algebra, dynamic geometry, spreadsheet, etc.), primarily focused on facilitating student experiments, and not on formal reasoning. Since including automated deduction tools in GeoGebra could bring a whole new range of teaching and learning scenarios, and since automated theorem proving and discovery in geometry has reached a rather mature stage, we embarked on a project of incorporating and testing a number of different automated provers for geometry in GeoGebra. In this paper, we present the current achievements and status of this project, and discuss various relevant challenges that this project raises in the educational, mathematical and software contexts. We will describe, first, the recent and forthcoming changes demanded by our project, regarding the implementation and the user interface of GeoGebra. Then we present our vision of the educational scenarios that could be supported by automated reasoning features, and how teachers and students could benefit from the present work. In fact, current performance of GeoGebra, extended with automated deduction tools, is already very promising—many complex theorems can be proved in less than 1 second. Thus, we believe that many new and exciting ways of using GeoGebra in the classroom are on their way. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Classifying learner engagement through integration of multiple data sources;"Beal C.R.; Qu L.; Lee H.";2006;Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) can provide effective instruction, but learners do not always use such systems effectively. In the present study, high school students' action sequences with a mathematics ITS were machine-classified into five finite-state machines indicating guessing strategies, appropriate help use, and independent problem solving; over 90% of problem events were categorized. Students were grouped via cluster analyses based on self Reports of motivation. Motivation grouping predicted ITS strategic approach better than prior math achievement (as rated by classroom teachers). Learners who Reported being disengaged in math were most likely to exhibit appropriate help use while working with the ITS, relative to average and high motivation learners. The results indicate that learners can readily Report their motivation state and that these data predict how learners interact with the ITS.

Identifying affective trajectories in relation to learning gains during the interaction with a tutoring system;"Padrón-Rivera G.; Rebolledo-Mendez G.";2015;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_109;;;Yes;;This paper presents the identification of sequences of affective states and its consequential impact to learning in an intelligent tutor for Mathematics at secondary level. These trajectories are represented as time series obtained by DAE 1.0 a software capable of detecting and labeling points in human faces in relation to affective states. Data was collected from students (N=44) in one secondary school, in a semirural town in Veracruz, Mexico. The students were asked to interact with the tutoring system for 40 minutes and were photographed by DAE 1.0 at a pace of 1 picture each 5 seconds. Based on a dataset consisting of 480 pictures per student, we employed the SAX algorithm to make the data discrete and facilitate the interpretation of the time series. The results of classifying the data using ID3 showed an accuracy of 62.85% in identification of affective trajectories related to higher learning gains. Future studies will seek to test this algorithm on a different data set with the aim of predicting performance towards personalizing affective interventions in the tutoring system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.
Comparison of four methodologies for modeling student retention in engineering;"Imbrie P.K.; Lin J.J.-J.; Reid K.";2010;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Several methodologies based on statistical methods or machine learning theories have been applied in previous studies for the modeling of student retention. However, most prior studies were based solely on a specific modeling method of authors' choice. Direct comparison of competing methods using identical collection of student retention data was rarely provided. The purpose of this paper is to present a direct comparison of prominent methods for modeling student retention using the same data. Four modeling methodologies (neural networks, logistic regression, discriminant analysis and structural equation modeling) are included in this study. These competing methods were implemented on five retention models with various collections of cognitive and non-cognitive factors, ranging from 9 to 71 variables. The retention data in this study were collected from more than 1500 first year engineering students in a large Midwestern university. The eleven cognitive attributes include high school GPAs, standardized test scores, and the grades and number of semesters in math, science and English courses in high school. The non-cognitive variables were collected through Student Attitudinal Success Instrument (SASI), covering the following nine constructs: Leadership, Deep Learning, Surface Learning, Teamwork, Academic Self-efficacy, Motivation, Metacognition, Expectancy-value, and Major Decision. The following findings are found during this study. First, among the five retention models, the two hybrid models with both cognitive and non-cognitive factors always perform better than models consisting of either only cognitive, or only non-cognitive factors. Second, the addition of non-cognitive items can significantly improve the prediction performance of a cognitive-only model when applied properly. Third, neural network methods perform better than the other three methodologies in performance indices, followed by logistic regression. However, logistic regression may be attractive to some researchers for its ease in implementation and lower requirements for computation power. Finally, the authors found the commonly used threshold (0.05) for including variables in stepwise selection process in logistic regression may not result in the best model for prediction performance. The authors strongly suggest that researchers explore beyond this typical threshold in order to find the best performing collection of variables. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.
Supporting K-12 STEM reform through K-12 STEM learning workshops at Singapore university of technology and design;"Bagiati A.; Christie P.D.; Dourmashkin P.; Brisson J.G.";2015;Proceedings of the 43rd SEFI Annual Conference 2015 - Diversity in Engineering Education: An Opportunity to Face the New Trends of Engineering, SEFI 2015;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;As our world is facing major technological, economic and social challenges, many governments around the globe have identified deficiencies in STEM education, while on the same time they are considering STEM fields to be the drivers of future technological and economical advancement [1-2]. ?As Reported through the international literature, countries have developed strategies that propose solutions to these STEM education deficiencies. Strategies have included different specialized programs for the primary, high school, and university education levels?[3]. In 2010, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began collaborating with the Singapore Ministry of Education to create the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The goal of this collaboration was the development ?of a new engineering-oriented university that will reach the Engineer of 2020 vision, while in parallel addressing the timely formation of an institutional identity and culture that borrows from those of MIT?[4]. Development of SUTD complements Singapore?s efforts to reform STEM education both at the pre-collegiate and at the university level. This paper describes why and how MIT has supported K-12 STEM Learning Initiatives at SUTD during the first 3 years of SUTD?s life. The workshops presented target K-12 teachers and students.Participant evaluations are also discussed.
Junior cyber discovery: Creating a vertically integrated middle school cyber camp;"Tims H.; Turner III G.E.; Cazes G.B.; Marshall J.M.";2012;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;"This paper describes an innovative partnership that was developed between high schools and their feeder middle schools in an effort to foster collaboration and mentoring among faculty while immersing rising 7th grade students in a week-long, project-driven day camp to develop interest and skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The middle school teachers received professional development and mentoring from their high school peers in addition to hands-on training with their students throughout the program. The students participated in activities that explore artificial intelligence and virtual reality which in turn cultivated their interest in the science and engineering aspects of cyberspace through interactive hands-on robotics and 3-D modeling. Socratic discussions concerning the social implications of the concepts presented were explored in depth through the use of movies that directly related to artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Examples from the camp will be presented along with lessons learned. The United States faces an unprecedented challenge in foreign competition in math, science, and engineering. Locally, we face the challenge of preparing a workforce versed in cyber issues as well as math, science, and engineering to fulfill the needs of the region. The problem over the last decade is that there has been a 50% decline in the students' interest in engineering and a 14% decrease in engineering degrees with only 2.1% of high school graduates likely to earn an engineering degree. This project cultivates an interest in cyber, computer programming, math, science, and engineering by exposing middle school teachers and their students to the new technology. The Cyber Discovery model was developed through a collaboration of mathematics, science, engineering, and liberal arts faculty from Louisiana Tech University and by staff from Cyber Innovation Center. The total immersive experience was aimed at high school teachers and their student teams. The culminating week-long residential camp exposed student participants to multiple topics of cyberspace including: history of cyberspace, ethical and social issues, applications, and the need for and use of security in cyberspace. Similar to Cyber Discovery, where the focus is on building relationships between university and high school faculty; Junior Cyber Discovery is a collaboration between teams of STEM and humanities teachers at the high school and middle school levels. Junior Cyber Discovery model engages middle school students. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education."
Making CS inclusive: An overview of efforts to expand and diversify CS education;"Aguar K.; Arabnia H.R.; Gutierrez J.B.; Potter W.D.; Taha T.R.";2017;Proceedings - 2016 International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence, CSCI 2016;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/CSCI.2016.0067;;;Yes;;Computer Science (CS) seems to be everywhere - in our smartphones, apps, cars, watches and so much more. It is integrated into almost every discipline and has a growing importance in our daily lives, yet even with top salaries, exciting companies, and promising careers, the job market remains underpopulated and under-representative of women. Though its applications are everywhere, CS is an often misunderstood field due to lack of exposure and knowledge. This paper explores the misperception associated with Computer Science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing CS earlier at the K-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses. © 2016 IEEE.
Fusion STEM project designs heads up display (HUD) for astronauts;"Cowan G.; Ebert M.";2014;Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;An innovative way to study STEM fields is to create an artificial intelligence system for a heads up display (HUD) for astronauts. The project was created in Silicon Valley, inspired by Google's Robot Cars, Google Glass, the emerging commercial space industry, and the community of bikers in the Bay Area. The project miniaturizes the concept of the robot car, tested on a bicycle helmet for the goal of creating an intuitive tool for human and robotic space exploration. Most of the skills used in this exercise are acquired by students utilizing topics from high school courses. The work established in this paper outlines the design of the unit and the educational standards covered. The project uses a unique way of applying physics, mathematics, and computer programming to expand ones knowledge of all three subjects beyond the normal precipice. Led by student innovation, the STEM project incorporates 21st century skills to prepare the next generation of astronautical scientists.
Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance;"Cortez P.; Silva A.";2008;15th European Concurrent Engineering Conference 2008, ECEC 2008 - 5th Future Business Technology Conference, FUBUTEC 2008;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Although the educational level of the Portuguese population has improved in the last decades, the statistics keep Portugal at Europe's tail end due to its high student failure rates. In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school Reports and ques-tionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision 'Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent's job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.
A closer look to artificial learning environments;"Coelho H.; Eusébio A.; Costa E.";1995;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;The so-called Intelligent Tutoring Systems evolved in the past five years to Intelligent Learning Environments. This shift was supported by the stronger role of software agents and the possible ways they can be used to promote human learning. The aim of this paper is to explore further on one possible style of formalization taking now a point of view from DAI in stead of AI and Education: a classroom is a small society of agents that can be simulated according to some specific goal defined by the user (say, the teacher). It will be based on a modification of the idea of deductive structures (DS), first proposed by Konolige. These DS will be accompanied by heuristic principles and criteria that define different types of societies and agents. The technical apparatus can be adopted in distinct educational scenarios from history to mathematics, and we will show, with an example, recent work in high school linear algebra. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995.
"Active learning in action, understanding the effects: What happens when the ""new"" wears off in teacher training";"Talley A.; Schmidt K.; Wood K.; Crawford R.";2008;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;In-service teacher training that focuses on Active Learning to teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education topics in K-12 has become quite prevalent. One such program, Design Technology and Engineering for America's Children (DTEACh), has offered summer STEM training workshops for teachers for over fifteen years. The participants are usually excited about the new training and the changes that they plan to make in classroom instruction. After the excitement fades, though, do the teachers implement the techniques presented in the training workshops? This study looks at the effects of the DTEACh training program on participants. A survey of the immediate effects and opinions of teachers was conducted at the end of each day of the two-week training held in 2004. Results show the teachers have a positive perception of the training. This paper seeks to investigate the effects of the DTEACh program on the instructional style of the teacher participants. Are the techniques presented in the training used by the teachers years later? Do the teachers recognize the method they are using? To answer these questions and others, teachers who participated in a DTEACh summer training workshop within the last seven years were surveyed to determine the instructional styles they use in the classroom. The results show that the majority implement the instructional techniques presented in the training. However, less than half of the teachers could describe the 5-step DTEACh teaching method presented to the participants and used to structure the training. This lack of recognition of the method is an unexpected finding, deserving of further investigation. The results of the study also revealed that the teachers who took the DTEACh training workshop three or more years before the survey showed very similar responses to teachers who attended the workshop more recently, thus indicating that use of techniques presented in the training workshop is not diminishing significantly with time. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2008.

A proposal to incorporate LEGO® Mindstorms™ into an introduction to engineering course;"Wakeman-Linn J.; Perry A.";2002;ASEE Annual Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Hands-on experiences excite interest in engineering students. Freshmen tend to be more interested in applications than theory, but they have many math and science courses confronting them before they can effectively apply what they learn. A freshman year course that shows engineering students the applications of the theory would help maintain a high level of interest. This paper introduces a robotics unit to give students that hands-on experience. Designed to be included in an introductory engineering class at the University of Wyoming, this unit utilizes the versatile components included in the LEGO® Mindstorms™ system. The unit addresses various concepts related to engineering principles and real life applications, such as remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and the integration of different components. Students working through this unit would design and build a series of robots beginning with one that uses a touch sensor to maneuver around obstacles and ending with a robot that mimics an animal's behavior, such as eating and sleeping. The construction requires a basic grasp of mechanical engineering concepts, and some programming ability, but use of the kits requires no previous skills. The LEGO®s kit encourages problem solving and teamwork. The unit was piloted with a pair of volunteer interns, both rising high school seniors. The volunteers worked with the unit in seven one-hour sessions. The interns chose to put in extra time to work on their projects, demonstrating the enthusiasm inspired by both the materials and the projects.
Scholar performance prediction using boosted regression trees techniques;"Stearns B.; Rangel F.; Rangel F.; De Faria F.F.; Oliveira J.";2017;ESANN 2017 - Proceedings, 25th European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;The possibility of predicting a student performance based only on their so- cioeconomic status may help to infer what cultural features are important in education.

An appraisal of an online tutorial system for the teaching and learning of engineering physics in conjunction with contextual physics and mathematics, and relevant mathematics;Bhathal R.;2016;European Journal of Engineering Education;Article;Scopus;10.1080/03043797.2015.1095162;;;Yes;;The number of students entering engineering schools in Australian universities has increased tremendously over the last few years because of the Australian Federal Government's policy of increasing the participation rates of Higher School Certificate students and students from low social economic status backgrounds in the tertiary sector. They now come with a diverse background of skills, motivations and prior knowledge. It is imperative that new methods of teaching and learning be developed. This paper describes an online tutorial system used in conjunction with contextual physics and mathematics, and the revision of the relevant mathematical knowledge at the appropriate time before a new topic is introduced in the teaching and learning of engineering physics. Taken as a whole, this study shows that students not only improved their final examination results but there was also an increase in the retention rate of first-year engineering students which has financial implications for the university. © 2015 SEFI.
Automated geometry theorem proving for human-readable proofs;"Wang K.; Su Z.";2015;IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Geometry reasoning and proof form a major and challenging component in the K-121 mathematics curriculum. Although several computerized systems exist that help students learn and practice general geometry concepts, they do not target geometry proof problems, which are more advanced and difficult. Powerful geometry theorem provers also exist, however they typically employ advanced algebraic methods and generate complex, difficult to understand proofs, and thus do not meet general K-12 students' educational needs. This paper tackles these weaknesses of prior systems by introducing a geometry proof system, iGeoTutor, capable of generating human-readable elementary proofs, i.e. proofs using standard Euclidean axioms. We have gathered 77 problems in total from various sources, including ones unsolvable by other systems and from Math competitions. iGeoTutor solves all but two problems in under two minutes each, and more importantly, demonstrates a much more effective and intelligent proof search than prior systems. We have also conducted a pilot study with 12 high school students, and the results show that iGeoTutor provides a clear benefit in helping students learn geometry proofs. We are in active discussions with Khan Academy and local high schools for possible adoption of iGeo-Tutor in real learning environments.

Adaptive user displays for intelligent tutoring software;Beal C.R.;2004;Cyberpsychology and Behavior;Review;Scopus;10.1089/cpb.2004.7.689;;;Yes;;"Intelligent tutoring software (ITS) holds great promise for K-12 instruction. Yet it is difficult to obtain rich information about users that can be used in realistic educational delivery settings-public school classrooms-in which eye tracking and other user sensing technologies are not suitable. We are pursuing three ""cheap and cheerful"" strategies to meet this challenge in the context of an ITS for high school math instruction. First, we use detailed representations of student cognitive skills, including tasks to assess individual users' proficiency with abstract reasoning, proficiency with simple math facts and computational skill, and spatial ability. Second, we are using data mining and machine learning algorithms to identify instructional sequences that have been effective with previous students, and to use these patterns to make decisions about current students. Third, we are integrating a simple focus-of-attention tracking system into the software, using inexpensive, web cameras. This coarse-grained information can be used to time the display of multimedia hints, explanations, and examples when the user is actually looking at the screen, and to diagnose causes of problem-solving errors. The ultimate goal is to create non-intrusive software that can adapt the display of instructional information in real time to the user's cognitive strengths, motivation, and attention."
Once upon a time in AI;Schank R.;2006;Artificial Intelligence;Short survey;Scopus;10.1016/j.artint.2006.10.010;;;Yes;;Roger Schank from Socratic Arts, Stuart, FL, US, is presenting his views regarding the developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and its role in education. Roger revealed that computer needed to have real goals that it actually needed to accomplish, an ability to understand when it had achieved those goals, and ability to explain why it had not achieved them, and an experiential data bases or prior attempts to achieve similar goals. Learnoing had to mean getting better at what user had just tried to do each time he tried. He reveals that he is designing a Virtual Science and Technology High school that has the first year entirely engineering or entrepreneurship. The idea is to teach reasoning, human relations, communication, problem solving, writing, and mathematics when needed in a realistic context that can lead to employable skills for further study.
How gamification applies for educational purpose specially with college algebra;"Faghihi U.; Brautigam A.; Jorgenson K.; Martin D.; Brown A.; Measures E.; Maldonado-Bouchard S.";2014;Procedia Computer Science;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1016/j.procs.2014.11.102;;;Yes;;"Gaming environments have been used to teach mathematical topics such as addition and division in a fun manner?. However, when it comes to college level mathematical concepts such as the use of the quadratic formula, there are very few software that explain these concepts in a fun way. In this paper, we present a first step towards using video game elements and Artificial Intelligence Tutoring system techniques to teach mathematical concepts such as factoring and the quadratic formula. These concepts are explained in a way that helps learners make a connection between the mathematical concepts and their real life experience. These methods of learning are supported by several studies (Bonwell & Eison, 1991; Donovan & Bransford, 2004; Scarlatos, 2006). We use gamification techniques during the training and test phases to help students learn the mathematical concepts. We then compare the performance of students who used our system (MathDungeon) with that of students who used the most popular math tutoring programs used in US colleges: Assessment and Learning, K-12, Higher Education (ALEKS). The number of students who used MathDungeon and scored above the median score on the test of math performance was greater than the number of students who used ALEKS and scored higher than the median score. © The Authors.

Specifically, a prototype of this system can be built at the university level to teach engineering principles including software engineering in context of cypber-physical system specifications, called the Health Quest CDSS. Students taking courses in senior design, as well as graduate students, are uniquely qualified to develop the specifications for a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that has both software and hardware components using languages such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Systems Modeling Language (SysML) [2], respectively within a cyber-physical system architectural framework. Education of young students from kindergarten to high school (K-12) can take place in a portal, where the design process is observed and mentoring can take place in the Science, Engineering, Technology, and Mathematics (STEM) component of the project [23]. Furthermore, this CDSS system specification and interactive STEM online portal development functions as an extension to the NASA Digital Astronaut Project [1]. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Feedback during web-based homework: The role of hints;"Singh R.; Saleem M.; Pradhan P.; Heffernan C.; Heffernan N.T.; Razzaq L.; Dailey M.D.; O'Connor C.; Mulcahy C.";2011;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-642-21869-9_43;;;Yes;;Prior work has shown that computer-supported homework can lead to better results over traditional paper-and-pencil homework. This study about learning from homework involved the comparison of immediate-feedback with tutoring versus a control condition where students got feedback the next day in math class. After analyzing eighth grade students who participated in both conditions, it was found that they gained significantly more (effect size 0.40) with computer-supported homework. This result has practical significance as it suggests an effective improvement over the widely used paper-and-pencil homework. The main result is followed with a second set of studies to better understand this result: is it due to the timeliness of feedback or quality tutoring? © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
An introduction to machine learning for students in secondary education;"Essinger S.D.; Rosen G.L.";2011;2011 Digital Signal Processing and Signal Processing Education Meeting, DSP/SPE 2011 - Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739219;;;Yes;;We have developed a platform for exposing high school students to machine learning techniques for signal processing problems, making use of relatively simple mathematics and engineering concepts. Along with this platform we have created two example scenarios which give motivation to the students for learning the theory underlying their solutions. The first scenario features a recycling sorting problem in which the students must setup a system so that the computer may learn the different types of objects to recycle so that it may automatically place them in the proper receptacle. The second scenario was motivated by a high school biology curriculum. The students are to develop a system that learns the different types of bacteria present in a pond sample. The system will then group the bacteria together based on similarity. One of the key strengths of this platform is that virtually any type of scenario may be built upon the concepts conveyed in this paper. This then permits student participation from a wide variety of educational motivation. © 2011 IEEE.

Geocaching as a means for modernization of educational process;"Zemko M.; Vitézová Z.; Jakab I.";2016;Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunting game using GPS (Global Positioning System). Participants navigate to a specific set of GPS coordinates and then attempt to find the geocache (treasure) hidden at a certain location. A hint can be used as a tool for seeking. Simple rules, variability and the chance to experience the unknown make the game more attractive for the millions of players of various age categories all over the world. It is popular especially among younger generations, therefore we were inspired to implement Geocaching in the secondary education processes to make the learning modern and attractive. The implementation is based on the transfer of Geocaching principles to the learning conditions of nowadays schools, when the geocache creation and the game realization become parts of educational process. Teacher can adjust the form and the content of geocaches according to own demands, the curriculum and school conditions. Geocaching has been divided according to our needs into three basic elements - coordinates, hint and treasure. We have processed a set of concrete proposals how to use these elements in the educational process. For better understanding we have identified 10 structural components such as number, locality, text, video, etc. which teacher can use, freely combine and apply according to own needs. Teacher can also decide which teaching strategy is the most suitable for subject or topic. One of the options is Problem-based learning in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem. This strategy was implemented in practice. We have tested our proposals on students of grammar school in freshman year. Their task was to solve set of mathematical problems using preferred procedures utilizing knowledge of the GPS and mathematics. Using the principles of the game brings to the learning process a lot of benefits such as active learning, motivation, promotion of interdisciplinary relations and much more. © The Authors, 2016.
An artificial intelligence-based distance education system: Artimat;"Nabiyev V.; Karal H.; Arslan S.; Erumit L.A.K.; Cebi A.";2013;Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education;Article;Scopus;;;;Yes;;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the artificial intelligence-based distance education system called as ARTIMAT, which has been prepared in order to improve mathematical problem solving skills of the students, in terms of conceptual proficiency and ease of use with the opinions of teachers and students. The implementation has been performed with 4 teachers and 59 students in 10th grade in an Anatolian High School in Trabzon. Many institutions and organizations in the world approach seriously to distance education besides traditional education. It is inevitable to use the distance education in teaching the problem solving skills in this different dimension of the education. In the studies in Turkey and abroad in the field of mathematics teaching, problem solving skills are generally stated not to be at the desired level and often expressed to have difficulty in teaching. For this reason, difficulties of the students in problem solving have initially been evaluated and the system has been prepared utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms according to the obtained results. In the evaluation of the findings obtained from the application, it has been concluded that the system is responsive to the needs of the students and is successful in general, but that conceptual changes should be made in order that students adapt to the system quickly.

Enriching education through data mining;Agrawal R.;2011;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference paper;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-642-23780-5_1;;;Yes;;Education is acknowledged to be the primary vehicle for improving the economic well-being of people [1,6]. TextBooks have a direct bearing on the quality of education imparted to the students as they are the primary conduits for delivering content knowledge [9]. They are also indispensable for fostering teacher learning and constitute a key component of the ongoing professional development of the teachers [5,8]. Many textBooks, particularly from emerging countries, lack clear and adequate coverage of important concepts [7]. In this talk, we present our early explorations into developing a data mining based approach for enhancing the quality of textBooks. We discuss techniques for algorithmically augmenting different sections of a Book with links to selective content mined from the Web. For finding authoritative articles, we first identify the set of key concept phrases contained in a section. Using these phrases, we find web (Wikipedia) articles that represent the central concepts presented in the section and augment the section with links to them [4]. We also describe a framework for finding images that are most relevant to a section of the textBook, while respectingglobal relevancy to the entire chapter to which the section belongs. We pose this problem of matching images to sections in a textBook chapter as an optimization problem and present an efficient algorithm for solving it [2]. We also present a diagnostic tool for identifying those sections of a Book that are notwell-written and hence should be candidates for enrichment. We propose a probabilistic decision model for this purpose, which is based on syntactic complexity of the writing and the newly introduced notion of the dispersion of key concepts mentioned in the section. The model is learned using a tune set which is automatically generated in a novel way. This procedure maps sampled text Book sections to the closest versions of Wikipedia articles having similar content and uses the maturity of those versions to assign need-for-enrichment labels. The maturity of a version is computed by considering the revision history of the corresponding Wikipedia article and convolving the changes in size with a smoothing filter [3]. We also provide the results of applying the proposed techniques to a corpus of widely-used, high school textBooks published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), India. We consider Books from grades IX–XII, covering four broad subject areas, namely, Sciences, Social Sciences, Commerce, and Mathematics. The preliminary results are encouraging and indicate that developing technological approaches to enhancing the quality of textBooks could be a promising direction for research for our field. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.
Removing remediation requirements: Effectiveness of intervention programs;"Fine A.; Duggan M.; Braddy L.";2009;PRIMUS;Article;Scopus;10.1080/10511970701678570;;;Yes;;Remediation of incoming college freshman students is a national concern because remediated students are at higher risk of failing to complete their degrees. Some Oklahoma higher education institutions are working to assist K-12 systems in finding ways to reduce the number of incoming college freshman students requiring remediation. This study investigated one such undertaking in which 12th-grade students took mathematics courses modeled after the East Central University ATLAS developmental mathematics program in an effort to enhance their performance on college admissions and placement assessments. A key feature of ATLAS is its use of an artificial intelligence-based learning system called ALEKS to hone mathematical skills. This study compared the efficacy of ATLAS-patterned high school mathematics courses with non-ALEKS-based mathematics courses or no mathematics course in removing remediation requirements for college-bound high school seniors. Results support the effectiveness of taking a senior-year high school mathematics course in reducing the number of college-bound high school seniors requiring mathematics remediation and also suggest that the ATLAS program may provide an alternative for some students to remove their college mathematics remediation requirements while still in high school. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Promoting stem education in North Dakota with high altitude balloons;"Saad M.; Fevig R.; Nolby C.; Seelan S.";2014;Proceedings of the International Astronautical Congress, IAC;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;The main objective of the North Dakota Space Grant Consortium (NDSGC) is to provide and support opportunities for our students to pursue research in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and prepare them for careers that support NASA's goals and the high-tech workforce development needs of North Dakota. One way this is done is through hands-on high altitude ballooning projects with both middle and high school students throughout the state. This active-learning pedagogy prepares students for real-world jobs that require critical thinking. Starting in the fall of 2011, the NDSGC has sponsored and organized the annual Near-Space Balloon Competition (NSBC), a state-wide competition which involves secondary student teams designing and constructing scientific payloads to be flown on a high altitude balloon in the spring of that school year. Professors and graduate students in the Department of Space Studies at the University of North Dakota work with the student teams throughout the school year, completing design reviews that lead up to the launch, chase, and retrieval of the high altitude balloon and payloads. Students complete research on subjects ranging from solar radiation and atmospheric properties to bacterial growth in a near-space environment. The upcoming NSBC is to take place in the fall of 2014. As an expansive initiative, in the fall of 2013, 124 eighth-grade students from Valley Middle School in Grand Forks, North Dakota, participated in a 3-week-long high altitude balloon payload mission. The students formulated hypotheses, designed, and constructed their own experimental payloads. They successfully flew these experiments on board two balloons which both surpassed 102, 000 feet (31 km). They were able to analyze the post-launch data in order to produce a final science Report, completing the scientific process. This ballooning practice was completed with another eighth grade class from Schroeder Middle School in Grand Forks, ND with a launch in May of 2014. A two-part self-assessment was used to determine how much the Valley Middle School students learned from the experience, as well as how much it changed their opinions about STEM subjects. The survey analysis revealed the students greatly appreciated and learned from this project, and these evaluations are being used to improve future high altitude ballooning practices with secondary students in North Dakota.

Sedaf: An intelligent educational system for mathematics;"Aiello L.; Micarelli A.";1990;Applied Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1080/08839519008927939;;;Yes;;"The field of artificial intelligence and education, in which A1 techniques and methodologies are used to build sophisticated intelligent educational systems, is developing rapidly. In this paper we present an intelligent educational system for teaching high school and college students how to analyze and draw graphs of mathematical functions. The system, named SEDAF, has been developed in a knowledge engineering environment and runs on a Lisp- machine workstation. We illustrate the various modules constituting SEDAF: the user interface; an expert module, capable of solving problems in the subject domain; a diagnosis module, which points out possible reasons for students’ errors; a student modeling module, capable of building an explicit representation of the learning status of the student; and a remedial subsystem, called a therapy module, constituted by means-ends tutorial rules that execute teaching actions on the base of the status of the student model. The goal of the presentation is to stress the innovative aspects of the architecture of SEDAF, in particular the use of metalevel knowledge to embed in the system the teaching expertise that allows the system to personalize its behavior to the specific student and to pursue a didactic plan. © 1990 by Hemisphere Publishing Corporation."
Development of communication robot for STEM education by using digital fabrication;Kadota K.;2017;Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics;Review;Scopus;10.20965/jrm.2017.p0944;;;Yes;;"This paper describes the development of a communication robot for STEM education, in which digital fabrication equipment such as a 3D printer and laser cutter are used. Specifically, although STEM education programs are active in several countries outside of Japan, they are not yet officially adopted in the curricula for Japanese elementary and junior high schools; however, a few undertakings exist outside schools. Meanwhile, the new curriculum guidelines announced in March 2017 by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) recognize the need for cross-subject activities and require elementary schools to introduce education on programmatic thinking. This suggests that STEM education-related activities will be introduced in Japanese school education in the near future and that educational programs that utilize robots will become increasingly active. Furthermore, the availability of technologies, such as speech recognition, artificial intelligence, and IoT, makes it highly likely that communication robots will be adopted in a variety of school situations. This study reviews the author’s development of a communication robot based on the use of digital fabrication technology within the context of STEM education; teaching plans are proposed, premised on the use of the STEM robot within the framework of the new curriculum guidelines that will be adopted by elementary and junior high schools in Japan from FY2020. © 2017, Fuji Technology Press.

Shaking up pre-calculus: Incorporating engineering into K-12 curricula;"Sabo C.; Burrows A.; Childers L.";2014;Advances in Engineering Education;Article;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Projects highlighting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education in high schools have promoted student interest in engineering-related fields and enhanced student understanding of mathematics and science concepts. The Science and Technology Enhancement Program (Project STEP), funded by a NSF GK-12 grant at the University of Cincinnati, is one community partnership that focused on improving STEM skills and communication. As a product of Project STEP, a lesson was developed and implemented in a local Cincinnati high school classroom on applying Trigonometry functions in pre-calculus to the study of Earthquake Engineering vibrations. This lesson, Shaking Up Pre-Calculus, shows that student involvement, understanding of the material, and interest in engineering can all be enhanced through innovative educational practices. Moreover, inquiry based lessons of this type can easily be made to meet educational standards and be incorporated into existing curricula. An overview, objectives, standards addressed, and assessments of the lesson are presented here in detail. Additionally, assessment results, student feedback, and reflections from the program participants are offered.
Design, development, and implementation of educational robotics activities for K-12 students;"Saygin C.; Yuen T.; Shipley H.; Wan H.D.; Akopian D.";2012;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference paper;Scopus;;;;Yes;;Educational robotics provides many opportunities to enhance science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for students and teachers by using engineering and computer programming techniques integrated into the curriculum. In addition to in-class activities, there are many programs targeting use of educational robotics in after-school activities. In this paper, we present our experience at the Interactive Technology Experience Center (iTEC) in design, development, and implementation of robotics activities for K-12 students and teachers. iTEC is a K-12 STEM center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which was established in 2007 with a mission to motivate young people to pursue careers in engineering by demonstrating advanced technologies and engaging them in interactive activities that build technical skills and foster critical thinking, self-confidence, communication, and leadership. Educational robotics activities discussed in this paper includes 1-day and 5-day camps for students, and a 2-day workshop for STEM teachers. Each activity is designed following a 5-step Active Learning Cycle (ALC) model. The 5-step ALC model is based upon active learning and engagement strategies developed by the iTEC team. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

Moroccan Teachers' Perceptions About Integrating Historical Contexts and AI in the Seamless Transition from Classical to Quantum Mechanics;Daoudi, Mohammed;2025;AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION;"Article; Early Access";WoS;10.1080/18117295.2025.2460911;;;;Yes;This article critically examines deficiencies in the final year high school programme, particularly in the Physics-Chemistry and Mathematics A and B specialties, focusing on the inadequate transition from classical to quantum mechanics. Based on teachers' perceptions, the study analyses the value of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and historical science narratives to address the complex relationship between classical and quantum mechanics. The analysis reveals a disjointed narrative hindering students' understanding during the critical transition phase, emphasising the insufficiency of a single lesson, 'Atom and Newton's Mechanics' at the academic year's end. The proposed comprehensive methodology for curriculum revision aims to seamlessly integrate historical narratives into the educational framework, providing a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness between classical and quantum mechanics. The discussion emphasises the potential positive impacts on student engagement, comprehension and enthusiasm for physics, extending beyond content adjustments to transform pedagogical strategies. The conclusion highlights the broader significance of these changes for science education, suggesting a curriculum overhaul informed by historical narratives and AI integration could shape a generation of scientifically literate individuals, adept at navigating contemporary physics complexities. The article serves as a call to action for teachers, curriculum developers and policymakers to innovate high school science education in line with the dynamic nature of scientific discovery.
Analysis of Machine Learning Classification Approaches for Predicting Students' Programming Aptitude;"Cetinkaya, Ali; Baykan, Omer Kaan; Kirgiz, Havva";2023;SUSTAINABILITY;Article;WoS;10.3390/su151712917;;;;Yes;With the increasing prevalence and significance of computer programming, a crucial challenge that lies ahead of teachers and parents is to identify students adept at computer programming and direct them to relevant programming fields. As most studies on students' coding abilities focus on elementary, high school, and university students in developed countries, we aimed to determine the coding abilities of middle school students in Turkey. We first administered a three-part spatial test to 600 secondary school students, of whom 400 completed the survey and the 20-level Classic Maze course on Code.org. We then employed four machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, and quadratic discriminant to classify the coding abilities of these students using spatial test and Code.org platform data. SVM yielded the most accurate results and can thus be considered a suitable ML technique to determine the coding abilities of participants. This article promotes quality education and coding skills for workforce development and sustainable industrialization, aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Preparing High School Teachers to Integrate AI Methods into STEM Classrooms;"Lee, Irene; Perret, Beatriz";2022;THIRTY-SIXTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / THIRTY-FOURTH CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / TWELVETH SYMPOSIUM ON EDUCATIONAL ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;In this experience Report, we describe an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Methods in Data Science (DS) curriculum and professional development (PD) program designed to prepare high school teachers with AI content knowledge and an understanding of the ethical issues posed by bias in AI to support their integration of AI methods into existing STEM classrooms. The curriculum consists of 5-day units on Data Analytics, Decision trees, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Transfer learning that follow a scaffolded learning progression consisting of introductions to concepts grounded in everyday experiences, hands-on activities, interactive web-based tools, and inspecting and modifying the code used to build, train and test AI models within Google Colab noteBooks. The participants in the PD program were secondary school teachers from the Southwest and Northeast regions of the United States who represented a variety of STEM disciplines: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Engineering, and Mathematics. We share findings on teacher outcomes from the implementation of two one-week PD workshops during the summer of 2021 and share suggestions for improvements provided by teachers. We conclude with a discussion of affordances and challenges encountered in preparing teachers to integrate AI education into disciplinary classrooms.
A graphically based machine learning approach to predict secondary schools performance in Tunisia;"Rebai, Sonia; Ben Yahia, Fatma; Essid, Hedi";2020;SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.seps.2019.06.009;;;;Yes;The main purpose of this paper is to identify the key factors that impact schools' academic performance and to explore their relationships through a two-stage analysis based on a sample of Tunisian secondary schools. In the first stage, we use the Directional Distance Function approach (DDF) to deal with undesirable outputs. The DDF is estimated using Data Envelopment Analysis method (DEA). In the second stage we apply machine-learning approaches (regression trees and random forests) to identify and visualize variables that are associated with a high school performance. The data is extracted from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 survey. The first stage analysis shows that almost 22% of Tunisian schools are efficient and that they could improve their students' educational performance by 15.6% while using the same level of resources. Regression trees findings indicate that the most important factors associated with higher performance are school size, competition, class size, parental pressure and proportion of girls. Only, school location appears with no impact on school efficiency. Random forests algorithm outcomes display that proportion of girls at school and school size have the most powerful impact on the predictive accuracy of our model and hence could more influence school efficiency. The findings disclose also the high non-linearity of the relationships between these key factors and school performance and reveal the importance of modeling their interactions in influencing efficiency scores.
Using random forest analysis to identify student demographic and high school-level factors that predict college engineering major choice;"Li Tan; Main, Joyce B.; Darolia, Rajeev";2021;JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1002/jee.20393;Yes;;Yes;Yes;"Background Given the importance of engineers to a nation's economy and potential innovation, it is imperative to encourage more students to consider engineering as a college major. Previous studies have identified a broad range of high school experiences and demographic factors associated with engineering major choice; however, these factors have rarely been ranked or ordered by relative importance.Purpose/HypoThesis This study leveraged comprehensive, longitudinal data to identify which high school-level factors, including high school characteristics and student high school experiences as well as student demographic characteristics and background, rank as most important in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice.Design/Method Using data from a nationally representative survey, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, and the random forest method, a genre of machine learning, the most important high school-level factors in terms of predictive power of engineering major choice were ranked.Results Random forest results indicate that student gender is the most important variable predicting engineering major choice, followed by high school math achievement and student beliefs and interests in math and science during high school.Conclusions Gender differences in engineering major choice suggest wider ranging cultural phenomena that need further investigation and systemic interventions. Research findings also highlight two other areas for potential interventions to promote engineering major choice: high school math achievement and beliefs and interests in math and science. Focusing interventions in these areas may lead to an increase in the number of students pursuing engineering."

Graph Neural Network for Senior High Student's Grade Prediction;"Yu, Yang; Fan, Jinfu; Xian, Yuanqing; Wang, Zhongjie";2022;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app12083881;;;;Yes;Senior high school education (SHSE) forms a connecting link between the preceding junior high school education and the following college education. Through SHSE, a student not only completes k-12 education, but also lays a foundation for subsequent higher education. The grade of the student in SHSE plays a critical role in college application and admission. Therefore, utilizing the grade of the student as an indicator is a reasonable method to instruct and ensure the effect of SHSE. However, due to the complexity and nonlinearity of the grade prediction problem, it is hard to predict the grade accurately. In this paper, a novel grade prediction model aiming to handle the complexity and nonlinearity is proposed to accurately predict the grade of the senior high student. To deal with the complexity, a graph structure is employed to represent the students' grades in all subjects. To handle the nonlinearity, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used to learn (or fit) the inner relation of the subject grades. The proposed grade prediction model based on graph neural network is tested on the dataset of Ningbo Xiaoshi High School. The results show that the proposed method performs well in the prediction of senior high school student grades.
An important component to investigating STEM persistence: the development and validation of the science identity (SciID) scale;"Lockhart, Mary Elizabeth; Kwok, Oi-Man; Yoon, Myeongsun; Wong, Raymond";2022;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEM EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1186/s40594-022-00351-1;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Background Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) influence almost every aspect of our daily lives. However, despite the high demand for STEM occupational talent, the STEM pipeline continues leaking, with less than one-sixth of high school students pursuing STEM majors and only 50% of entering STEM college majors matriculating into STEM fields. Science identity has been identified as the most powerful predictor of high school students pursuing an undergraduate STEM major as Reported by Chang (Machine learning approach to predicting STEM college major choice, American Educational Research Association (AERA), San Francisco, 2020). Though the construct is gaining lots of attention, it remains largely ill-defined, not operationalized at the high school level, and not based upon traditional identity theory. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable instrument that measures high school students' science identity, the Science Identity (SciID) Scale. Results Subject experts and a small group of high school students provided content validation for the proposed scale. Exploratory factor analysis revealed an optimal two-factor solution, reflecting the traditional two-dimensions of identity theory: Exploration and Commitment. Cronbach's alpha revealed good internal consistency for both factors. Finally, structural equation modeling confirmed the convergent validity of the instrument with the external variables of science achievement and science career interest. Furthermore, the divergent validity between science identity and science self-concept was also confirmed. Conclusions Initial results indicate that the SciID Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that accurately measures a high school student's standing on this construct. The soundness of this instrument will enable policy makers and practitioners to design more effective intervention programs aimed at cultivating high school students' science identity.
Engaging High School and Engineering Students: A Multifaceted Outreach Program Based on a Mechatronics Platform;"Habash, Riadh W. Y.; Suurtamm, Christine";2010;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1109/TE.2009.2025659;;;;Yes;If we aim to enhance the interest of students in engineering and therefore produce the best engineers, it is essential to strengthen the pipeline to high school education. This paper discusses several outreach activities undertaken by the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa (UO), Ottawa, ON, Canada, to help the transition between high school and engineering education and to make students aware of the engineering profession. At the heart of these activities is mechatronics education, which demands an interdisciplinary approach, connects to fundamental math and science concepts, and promotes collaborative project-based learning (PBL). Connected to this focus, a multifaceted program of outreach activities has been initiated. The program includes creation of design-simulate-and-build projects by engineering and high school students, as well as an interactive presentation program whereby engineering students connect with high school students through the sharing of projects that they create in their engineering courses. The survey results indicate that for the high school students, these programs promote students' awareness of engineering and how the mathematics and science they take in school connects to engineering concepts. For the engineering students, they are provided with a meaningful context within which to share their projects and explain their own understanding of engineering principles.

The Development and Effect Analysis of Customized Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics Convergence Program for Vocational High Schools;"Park, Jeong In; Kim, Seong Baeg";2022;The Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;With the development of artificial intelligence, education to understand and use the principles of artificial intelligence is increasingly necessary. From the second semester of the 2021 academic year, the subject, which can learn how mathematics is used in the field of artificial intelligence, has been opened as a career elective course. Vocational high school students are generally weak in basic mathematics and have difficulties in understanding mathematics. Therefore, effective teaching of artificial intelligence mathematics is required. However, there are still few studies on vocational high school students on artificial intelligence mathematics education methods. Therefore, in this study, in order to help understand artificial intelligence and understand the principles of artificial intelligence, teaching and learning materials were developed and analyzed through classes focusing on straight equations that vocational high school students can understand.The effects of artificial intelligence mathematics education programs were analyzed by dividing them into change in ‘AI value perception', ‘change in AI efficacy', and ‘change in mathematics value perception'. As a result of the analysis, we found that there was a significant improvement in all items. such as changes in AI value perception. The research results can be used as basic data to come up with measures to effectively educate artificial intelligence mathematics considering the situation of each high school.
The Dynamic Vectors-Based Attention Model for Chinese Mathematical Term Extraction;"Zhong, Maosheng; Kuang, Jiangling; Liu, GanLin; Hua, Xin; Wu, Jiahua";2023;IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS;Article;WoS;10.1109/MIS.2023.3246240;;;;Yes;Term extraction aims to extract domain-specific terminology from documents. Secondary school mathematics terminology plays a guiding role in the learning and teaching of secondary school mathematics. We found that there needs to be more work in this field and that there are two main issues in extracting the terms from the middle school mathematics text: the polysemy of one character problem and nested terms problem. Accordingly, we have constructed a secondary school mathematics corpus and proposed a model to resolve these problems, termed BERT-LLA-CRF. Using pretraining to obtain dynamic word vectors to improve the model's understanding of text semantics and solve the problem of multiple meanings of one word, the proposed model integrates attention mechanisms and Chinese character information to solve the nested terminology problem. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively solves those problems and achieves good middle-school mathematics term extraction results.

A Study on the Revision Direction of High School Mathematics Education for Artificial Intelligence Literacy;Hong-Kyeom, Kim?;2021;Journal of Education & Culture;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;As the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses, numerous areas of our society are experiencing profound change. Artificial intelligence is at the core of this change, accomplishing things that humans have never achieved before. In line with the development of artificial intelligence, many countries worldwide, such as Korea, strive to nurture competent people in artificial intelligence-related fields, and many state that artificial intelligence education should be strengthened. However, the discourse on appropriate future directions for artificial intelligence is still lacking. Therefore, this study considered that the appropriate direction for artificial intelligence education lies in fostering artificial intelligence literacy. To this end, we explored how the contents of high school mathematics, a core subject related to artificial intelligence, should change.The content of current high school mathematics education is insufficient to understand the artificial intelligence era we are expected to face. To enable students to understand the artificial intelligence era, or to attain artificial intelligence literacy, artificial intelligence-related factors should be added to the contents of existing mathematics.Artificial intelligence literacy will require the provision of education on the matrix, spatial vectors, algorithms, decision-making and optimization, and graph theory of discrete mathematics.

Developing a cognitive model of solid geometry based on Interpretive Structural Modeling method;"Zhang, Heyang; Wu, Xiaopeng; Ju, Mingyue";2024;HELIYON;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e27063;;;Yes;Yes;With the advancement of science and artificial intelligence, education is experiencing significant innovation. The adaptive learning system is emerging as a promising approach to achieving personalized learning. The cognitive model plays a crucial role as the fundamental rationale behind the adaptive learning system. Currently, there is no uniform and highly operational method for constructing cognitive models. This study adopts Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) as the foundational approach for constructing a cognitive model of solid geometry. Based on literature and expert opinions, 17 cognitive attributes of high school solid geometry were identified. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey involving 40 experts was conducted to establish the contextual relationships among these attributes. Applying the ISM method resulted in a sevenlevel model. This model was then revised based on expert opinions to create the final cognitive model, revealing three primary paths within the domain of high school solid geometry. This paper contends that the use of the ISM method for constructing cognitive models is effective and objective. The resulting cognitive model unveils the content structure of high school solid geometry, and provides an innovative perspective on the construction of cognitive models.
Deep learning practice for high school student engagement in STEM careers;"Santana, Otacilio Antunes; de Sousa, Barbara Alves; do Monte, Sandra Razana Silva; de Freitas Lima, Mayara Lopes; Ferraz e Silva, Caina";2020;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON 2020);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/educon45650.2020.9125281;;;;Yes;The use of deep learning activities at the educational stage is quite relevant for student engagement (positive or negative) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. Physical contact with hardware, visual and interactive contact with software, and contact with algorithms are practices in which students observe the complexity of command could result in ingenious automation and task accomplishment (universal approximation theorem and/or probabilistic inference). Deep learning came to this work as a tool for solving a problem: How do we identify forage palm (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill, Cactaceae) for feeding goats, in an area under Semi-arid climate? High school students on advisory teachers of various disciplines (biology, chemical, physical, mathematics, geography, and others) attempt to answer to this question: Did student engagement happen by new context, problem to be solved, data collection (hardware), or data analysis (algorithm and software)? Sixty-seven high school students from Brazilian public schools (from 14 to 17 years old) participated in the proposed following teacher. High school students get more involved by practical and technological issues (mechanisms and hardware) than in scenario (new context) or by evaluation and discussion of the purpose. This data about the preference of one stage over other stages of Deep Learning determined the application for undergraduate courses in STEM. This was the most relevant data of this work, despite total engagement, students' preferences in one stage point out the student's academic vocation.
A Review: Predicting Student Success at Various Levels of their Learning Journey in a Science Programme;"Mabunda, Judith Goodness Khanyisa; Jadhav, Ashwini; Ajoodha, Ritesh";2021;2021 IEEE INTERNATIONAL IOT, ELECTRONICS AND MECHATRONICS CONFERENCE (IEMTRONICS);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422519;;;;Yes;This paper examines how features affect student persistence or dropout at South African higher education institutions, based on three previous studies. In the previous studies, high school grades were used as a valid predictor of student success. The quality of a high school's learning environment has an effect on almost every aspect of higher education success. Students who are better prepared coming out of high school are ideally suited to do well in higher education institutions, who they are, how much money they have, and where they go don't matter. This review aims to identify effective features that warrant student success from high school grades and choice of academic courses during registration in higher education. The following questions are used to guide this review: How can we define student success? Which features should we focus on? Which models work? Based on data mining techniques such as machine learning models that the previous studies have used to predict student success, it has been revealed that the most important features that influence student success in a Computer Science programme are Prior Computer experience, Mathematics, English from High school and the choice of a course.

Quantum Computing for High-School Students An Experience Report;"Angara, Prashanti Priya; Stege, Ulrike; MacLean, Andrew";2020;IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON QUANTUM COMPUTING AND ENGINEERING (QCE20);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/QCE49297.2020.00047;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Quantum computing is an emerging field that can revolutionize our ability to solve problems and enable breakthroughs in many areas including optimization, machine learning, chemistry, and drug design. With the increasing computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing increases significantly. The theory of quantum computing lies at the crossroads of quantum physics, mathematics, and computer science. The field of quantum computing has matured and can now be explored by all students. While today, quantum computers and simulators are readily accessible and programmable over the internet, quantum computing education is just ramping up. This paper describes our experiences in organizing and delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students with little or no experience in the above-mentioned fields. We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. Overall, we take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Q Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter noteBooks. Our experiences and findings suggest that basic quantum computing concepts are palatable for high-school students, and-due to significant differences between classical and quantum computing-early exposure to quantum computing is a valuable addition to the set of problem-solving and computing skills that high-schoolers obtain before entering university.
Differences in Academic Preparedness Do Not Fully Explain Black-White Enrollment Disparities in Ad-vanced High School Coursework;"Souto-Maior, Joao M.; Shroff, Ravi";2024;SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.15195/v11.a6;;;;Yes;Whether racial disparities in enrollment in advanced high school coursework can be attributed to differences in prior academic preparation is a central question in sociological research and education policy. However, previous investigations face methodological limitations, for they compare race -specific enrollment rates of students after adjusting for characteristics only partially related to their academic preparedness for advanced coursework. Informed by a recently -developed statistical technique, we propose and estimate a novel measure of students' academic preparedness and use administrative data from the New York City Department of Education to measure differences in Advanced Placement (AP) mathematics enrollment rates among similarly prepared students of different races. We find that preexisting differences in academic preparation do not fully explain the under -representation of Black students relative to White students in AP mathematics. Our results imply that achieving equal opportunities for AP enrollment not only requires equalizing earlier academic experiences, but also addressing inequities that emerge from coursework placement processes.
AI for the Workforce of Tomorrow: Attending to Ethics and Collaboration in Learning Artificial Intelligence for High School Aged Youth;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"As AI becomes increasingly integral to a broad range of industries, it is critical that the field develops equitable and justice-oriented instructional models that can support youth to integrate technical knowledge about AI with ethical principles for AI development and deployment. This project will design and study an online course for high school aged youth that is a collaborative learning experience for building workforce skills. The project will strengthen and broaden youth capacity for, and disposition toward, artificial intelligence (AI) domains and careers. Learning activities will provide youth with opportunities to develop AI systems grounded in real-world contexts that are relevant to this age group including college applications, health care, and social media, enabling them to draw on their own personal and cultural knowledge. Through its implementation, the project will address three important national needs: (1) increasing and expanding AI workforce capacity; (2) attending to the social and ethical concerns associated with AI; and (3) broadening participation in AI understanding to bring a greater diversity of lived experiences to the AI workforce and greater STEM field. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Using surveys, observations, and interviews within a design-based research approach, the researchers will address the following research questions: (1) How can instruction be designed to integrate AI technical knowledge with AI ethics principles in an online learning experience that also encourages and supports positive social interaction and collaboration among participants? How do specific design features and pedagogical strategies contribute to a coherent approach? (2) To what extent, for whom, and under what conditions does this AI instructional model support: (a) AI technical learning; (b) capacity to integrate ethics in AI development; and (c) dispositional changes (sense of belonging in AI; value assigned to STEM ethics integration)? (3) What infrastructure is necessary to support this work beyond the life of the grant; and how can this program be institutionalized? This project will advance knowledge toward building a more inclusive approach to integrating ethical principles within technical training. This will increase the likelihood that the future workforce will be attentive to ethical concerns and better reflect the views and backgrounds of the populations that the technology is supposed to serve. Through the intentional design for productive online collaboration, the project will contribute to improved learning outcomes in online spaces. Project deliverables include an online course with educator supports and custom-designed digital tools, empirical findings and presentations for research and practitioner communities, and design principles for online, collaborative, sociotechnical learning environments. The AI course will be offered to six cohorts of 20 students each. Participants will be recruited from high schools in the western United States that receive Title I funding. The resulting course resource will be designed for sustainable implementation and positioned for implementation at scale across similar institutions nationally.

Machine Learning Analysis for Predicting College STEM Majors with the Affective Domain in Learning Mathematics;"Ka, Yeonseok; Jihyun, Hwang";2024;The Journal of Educational Research in Mathematics;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;This study developed and analyzed models to predict the selection of STEM majors in college based on the affective domain characteristics of students during their middle and high school years, using data from the Korean Education Longitudinal Study 2005. Instrumental motivation, intrinsic motivation towards mathematics, self-efficacy in mathematics, and beliefs about intelligence were used as independent variables for prediction based on the data from the second grade of middle school and the first grade of high school. Logistic models, Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, and Random Forest models were applied, and the optimal prediction model was sought by comprehensively considering various indicators. In the case of using the data from the second grade of middle school, the MLP model showed superior predictive power compared to other models. In the case of using the data from the first grade of high school, all models did not show good predictive power. The model based on the data from the second grade of middle school was deemed to have practical applicability. These results suggest that while the affective domain regarding mathematics is an important factor in the choice of a STEM major, more diverse variables and complex models are needed for predicting majors during high school years. Additionally, while recognizing the limitations of machine learning models, more theoretical discussions are needed on the relationship between major selection and the affective elements of mathematics, and it is hoped that various prediction models will be developed and used in actual practice.

Exploring Theory and Design Principles (ETD): Auditing Machine Learning Applications for Algorithmic Justice with Computer Science High School Students and Teachers;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;There is an urgent need to develop and implement learning programs that can help teachers to prepare students to effectively interact with and critically evaluate machine learning applications. This project will work with a group of high school teachers across rural, suburban, and urban US communities in California, Delaware and Pennsylvania serving diverse high school students including Black, Latinx, and gender-marginalized young people to design and implement classroom activities that will support students in developing and ???auditing??? machine learning applications. The goal of algorithm auditing is to better understand the opaque inner workings of AI systems by repeatedly querying the AI system in order to interpret its external effects and impacts. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. In the three-year study, 210 high school students will directly participate in the learning of algorithm auditing. Researchers and computer science high school teachers will co-investigate students??? machine-learning-powered, sensor-based applications and integrate collaborative algorithm auditing practices to examine fairness, accountability, and justice. The research will be conducted in partnership with public high school teachers from the Exploring Computer Science community and address the following questions: (a) What are high school computer science teachers??? values and considerations of algorithmic justice in machine learning applications?, (b) How do high school computer science teachers understand and develop new understandings of algorithmic justice in machine learning applications through auditing?, What implications do teachers find in algorithm auditing for their teaching and with their students?, (c) How do high school computer science teachers integrate and support students??? collaborative audits of machine learning applications in classrooms?, and (d) What are high school students??? approaches and perspectives when auditing machine learning applications? How does this affect their interests in CS and STEM careers? To answer these research questions, researchers will use a combination of observational methods, interviews and surveys to gain insights into teachers??? understandings of algorithm audits, observe high school students designing and auditing machine learning applications, and examine student learning in classroom implementation of auditing activities. Previous research on algorithm auditing for non-experts, including both adults and youth, has only focused on informal settings. The insights gained about teaching and learning algorithm auditing in this school-based investigation can be extended to and inform numerous existing computing activities as well as K???12 computing curricula and teacher professional development. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
A Case Study of High School Student‘s Mathematics Teaching and Learning using a Learning Platform;"Ko, Ho Kyoung; ???; ???";2022;East Asian Mathematical Journal;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;Recently, various platforms of education technology (Edu-Tech) that use artificial intelligence have been developed in the field of mathematics education.

AI-Driven Educational Transformation in Secondary Schools: Leveraging Data Insights for Inclusive Learning Environments;"Duraes, Dalila; Bezerra, Rita; Novais, Paulo";2024;2024 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE, EDUCON 2024;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578910;;Yes;Yes;Yes;In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a progressive trend towards teaching that is more personalised to students' characteristics and some models of prediction failure that are more accurate. In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices.This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students.The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands.Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments.In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.
Utilization Status and Effectiveness Analysis of Edutechs in Elementary and Secondary Schools;Kim, Pyung;2024;Asia-pacific Journal of Convergent Research Interchange;research-article;WoS;10.47116/apjcri.2024.12.20;;;;Yes;With the development of AI technology, the utilization of AI is rapidly increasing in the automation of tasks and prediction and analysis services across education and industry. Edutech with AI functions in education is used to support students and teachers' teaching and learning activities. In this study, we analyzed the utilization status of edutech by school level and subject, the main functions of edutech with a high frequency of utilization, Edutech-based education at each stage of education, and edutech support functions and effectiveness at each stage of learning, focusing on cases of Edutech utilization in elementary and secondary schools. In elementary and secondary schools, classes utilizing edutech were actively conducted in mathematics, Korean/literature, foreign language/English, and practical arts/information/artificial intelligence. For students, Edutech contributed to improving the learning experience and accessibility, identifying achievement levels, learning speed, and tendencies, providing customized learning, supporting students' self-directed learning, and increasing participation through cooperative learning and stimulating interest. For teachers, we provide learning content for efficient class operation, support for learning status and creation of customized educational content, diagnostic evaluation support, and customized feedback, thereby providing an environment where teachers can focus more on reducing their teaching workload and supporting students. To activate edutech in the educational field in the future, we must continue to make efforts to minimize the side effects of introducing edutech and increase the effectiveness of education by improving the school education infrastructure and educational model, as well as enhancing the digital literacy of teachers and students and their understanding of AI technology and edutech.

Student Low Achievement Prediction;"Zanellati, Andrea; Zingaro, Stefano Pio; Gabbrielli, Maurizio";2022;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION, PT I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5_76;;;;Yes;In this paper, we propose a method for assessing the risk of low achievement in primary and secondary school. We train three machine learning models with data collected by the Italian Ministry of Education through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests. We compare the results of the trained models and evaluate the effectiveness of the solutions in terms of performance and interpretability. We test our methods on data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects.

Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are topics of great importance and interest but are often reserved for higher-level education. Introductions of complex subjects in high school promotes student efficacy, enthusiasm, and skill-development for STEM careers. Establishing strong partnerships between universities and high schools is mutually beneficial for the professional development of students, teachers, and professors. In this paper, we detail immersive outreach efforts and their effectiveness in a high school setting.Methods From Spring 2021 to Spring 2024, we conducted eight data-science and analysis-coding style workshops along with two data science units, with 302 students participating in the data science workshops and 82 students in the data science units. All students who participated in the data science lessons completed a comprehensive final project. Surveys measuring knowledge and appeal to data science and coding were conducted both retrospectively and prospectively, before and after each workshop and the data science units. A 1 year follow up survey was conducted for students in the 2023 data science lessons (n = 23).Results Overall, average student interest significantly increased from 2.72 +/- 1.08/5.0 (n = 205) to 3.15 +/- 1.18/5.0 (n = 181, p = 0.001) during the data science workshops, while 70% of students expressed desire to continue with coding. Interest modestly increased in the data science lessons from 3.15 +/- 0.65/4.0 to 3.17 +/- 0.77/4.0 (n = 82, p = 0.8571), while knowledge significantly increased from 64.16% to 88.5% (% correct out of six questions) in the 2023 data science lessons and from 52.62% to 60.79% (% correct out of 29 questions) in the 2024 data science lessons.Discussion Increasing STEM exposure through outreach programs and a modified curriculum can positively alter students' career trajectory and prepare them for the evolving technologically advanced world and the careers within it.
Analysis of Secondary Mathematics Knowledge for AI Learning through the AI related R&E Program;Gu, Heo Nam;2020;The Journal of Learner-Centered Curriculum and Instruction;research-article;WoS;10.22251/jlcci.2020.20.16.673;;;;Yes;With the recent development of information and communication, it has become essential to understand and utilize artificial intelligence, and it is necessary to understand mathematical knowledge in order to understand artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Education announced the development plan for the subject 'Artificial Intelligence Mathematics', which includes mathematical contents for understanding and utilizing artificial intelligence through mathematical concepts needed for artificial intelligence. Many high school students are interested in artificial intelligence, and teachers are also interested in artificial intelligence to teach students. However, research on mathematical knowledge that high school students need to understand artificial intelligence is lacking. In this study, we investigated the mathematical knowledge required in the course of performing the AI related R&E program, and we examined the connection with the 2015 revised curriculum. As a result, the matrix, the limit of functions, the differentials of functions, harmonic averages and sampling helped students understand the basic knowledge of artificial intelligence.
Intelligent Placement Model Based On Decision Tree;"Cai, CongYu; Lu, Huijuan; Yan, Ke; Ye, Minchao";2018;2018 NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MEDICINE AND EDUCATION (ITME 2018);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ITME.2018.00188;;;;Yes;Recently, the analysis of big data based on artificial intelligence algorithms has shown great potential in the field of education system However, due to the complexity of the education system, the problem of students' placement in primary and secondary schools (matching problem of students and teachers) still exists.

In the experimental results, the proposed method (ID3 algorithms and C4.5 algorithm) achieves high matching accuracy.
The More Anxious, the More Dependent? The Impact of Math Anxiety on AI-Assisted Problem-Solving;"Chen, Feng; Chen, Jihe; Xu, Yanying";2025;PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS;Article;WoS;10.1002/pits.23500;;;Yes;Yes;"Although the use of AI technology driven by anxiety has become increasingly common, research on the relationship between high school students' math anxiety and their intention to use AI for problem-solving remains limited. This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, aims to explore the relationship between math anxiety and the intention to use AI for solving math problems among high school students. Using the Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the AI Problem-Solving Behavior Scale (AIPS), data from 391 high school students were collected. The analysis revealed the following: (1) Students Report high levels of math anxiety and a strong inclination to use AI tools for solving math problems; (2) Social support plays a significant role in alleviating math anxiety, with family support being the most effective, followed by support from friends and teachers; (3) High levels of family support are the most effective means of reducing math anxiety. The study suggests that the relationship between math anxiety and AI use intention should be addressed, with a focus on regulating the application of AI in math education to promote its scientific and effective use. Additionally, improving family relationships and providing mental health support are recommended to alleviate math anxiety from an emotional and social support perspective. This study provides valuable insights for educators and policymakers, offering important references for designing more human-centered and effective educational interventions, thereby promoting the application of artificial intelligence technology in mathematics education."
Apply Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict At-Risk Students to Admission Period;Embarak, Ossama;2020;2020 SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TRENDS (ITT 2020);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ITT151279.2020.9320878;;;;Yes;Educational organizations have a high burden of treating students with poor academic success (At-risk students). Many methods are pursued to help this group of pupils, such as psychological, a proper schedule for the vulnerable pupil, recall, personal training, mocktests, private education by direct studies, or the success centers. However, these approaches are not enough to deal with the dilemma, since other variables are impacting the success of the learner, which may be their family problems, their cognitive style, Their previous academic accomplishment, the cornerstone of the college level. This paper explores the effect of pre-college academic accomplishments on the success of college students in the computer program. The pilot study predicts student academic success based on their math (EmSAT Math), English (EmSAT English), and High School Average (High School Average) knowledge and skills acquired by students before college entry. The study covers 120 students. After cleaning up the available data, we are left with 112 instances used to train machine learning models to predict learner performance in the computer program. The qualified models achieved a high precision of 90.5 percent (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest), while the Logistic Regression achieved a forecast accuracy of 78.1 percent. The main symptom for the student's academic status was the score in English, followed by the score in Math. The research has shown that the high school score is not the secret to predicting students with academic status at their college stage.
Gentle Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for High-School Students Using Scratch;"Estevez, Julian; Garate, Gorka; Grana, Manuel, Jr.";2019;IEEE ACCESS;Article;WoS;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956136;;;;Yes;The importance of educating the next generations in the understanding of the fundamentals of the upcoming scientific and technological innovations that will force a broad social and economical paradigm change can not be overstressed. One such breakthrough technologies is Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning algorithms. Nowadays, the public has little understanding of the workings and implications of AI techniques that are already entering their lives in many ways. We aim to achieve widespread public understanding of these issues in an experiential learning framework. Following a design based research approach, we propose to implement program coding scaffoldings to teach and experiment some basic mechanisms of AI systems. Such experiments would be shedding new light into AI potentials and limitations. In this paper we focus on innovative ways to introduce high school students to the fundamentals and operation of two of the most popular AI algorithms. We describe the elements of a workshop where we provide an academic use-create-modify scaffolding where students work on the Scratch partial coding of the algorithms so they can explore the behavior of the algorithm, gaining understanding of the underlying computational thinking of AI processes. The extent of the impact on the students of this experience is measured through questionnaires filled before and after participation in the workshop. Preliminary experiments offer encouraging results, showing that the workshop has differential impact on the way students understand AI.
Enhancing Computational Thinking Skills Through Artificial Intelligence Education at a STEAM High School;"Huang, Xiaodong; Qiao, Chengche";2024;SCIENCE & EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1007/s11191-022-00392-6;Yes;;Yes;Yes;Artificial intelligence is the unification of philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, information theory, cybernetics, and uncertainty theory. Therefore, it is feasible and necessary to utilize STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Liberal Arts, and Mathematics) education to learn artificial intelligence courses. Computational thinking skills are of vital importance to high school students. This paper integrates artificial intelligence education with STEAM model with the aim of enhancing students' computational thinking skills. First, we investigate the feasibility of this model and set teaching objectives about artificial intelligence curricula. Second, artificial intelligence curricula with STEAM model is proposed to carry out interdisciplinary artificial intelligence knowledge acquisition. Finally, the effects of this model on students' computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy are evaluated. One hundred thirty-six participants are recruited from a high school in Beijing. The results reveal that the integration of artificial intelligence education with STEAM is able to promote computational thinking skills, learning motivation, and self-efficacy of the students in the experimental group. The main implication of this study is that artificial intelligence education in light of STEAM model can be used as a teaching guide for the combination of artificial intelligence curricula with multi-disciplinary knowledge at the primary and secondary levels.
Detecting Teachers' in-Classroom Interactions Using a Deep Learning Based Action Recognition Model;"Kuromiya, Hiroyuki; Majumdar, Rwitajit; Ogata, Hiroaki";2022;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION: POSTERS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS, WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION TRACKS, PRACTITIONERS AND DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM, PT II;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-11647-6_74;;;;Yes;In-classroom observations often rely on developed protocols and human observers. However, it requires a lot of human effort. This study investigates how accurately the pre-trained action recognition model can label teacher's behaviors in the classroom. We adopt SlowFast, a state of the art action recognition model, to a real classroom at a junior-high school mathematics class in Japan. In a pilot study of a mathematics class in a junior high school, the pre-trained model had 92.7% accuracy to identify teacher's posture, 31.7% related to the teacher's interaction with objects, and 26.8% related to teacher-student interaction. Compared to the existing baseline (34.3%), our results indicate that the pre-trained model adopts well to classroom videos as well. Possible reasons for the low accuracy of the verbs in the last two categories are (1) the pre-trained model could not sufficiently deal with objects unique to the classroom, such as a whiteboard, and (2) the teacher wore masks as an infection control measure, which made it difficult to recognize teacher's talking behavior. This study provides an initial automated approach to have a teacher's in-classroom interaction dataset extracted from the class videos. One needs to be aware of the ethical implementation and then such deep learning technologies have potential for a data-driven paradigm for the teacher's in action reflection.
A machine learning approximation of the 2015 Portuguese high school student grades: A hybrid approach;"Costa-Mendes, Ricardo; Oliveira, Tiago; Castelli, Mauro; Cruz-Jesus, Frederico";2021;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-020-10316-y;;;;Yes;This article uses an anonymous 2014-15 school year dataset from the Directorate-General for Statistics of Education and Science (DGEEC) of the Portuguese Ministry of Education as a means to carry out a predictive power comparison between the classic multilinear regression model and a chosen set of machine learning algorithms. A multilinear regression model is used in parallel with random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting machine stacking ensemble implementations. Designing a hybrid analysis is intended where classical statistical analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms are blended to augment the ability to retain valuable conclusions and well-supported results. The machine learning algorithms attain a higher level of predictive ability. In addition, the stacking appropriateness increases as the base learner output correlation matrix determinant increases and the random forest feature importance empirical distributions are correlated with the structure ofp-values and the statistical significance test ascertains of the multiple linear model. An information system that supports the nationwide education system should be designed and further structured to collect meaningful and precise data about the full range of academic achievement antecedents. The article concludes that no evidence is found in favour of smaller classes.
Early Prediction of Student Performance in Online Programming Courses;"Liu, Enqi; Koprinska, Irena; Yacef, Kalina";2023;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION. POSTERS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS, WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION TRACKS, PRACTITIONERS, DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM AND BLUE SKY, AIED 2023;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-36336-8_57;;;;Yes;Early prediction of student grades is important for both teachers and students. It can help teachers take timely remedial actions to avoid drop-out and poor learning outcomes, and also help students improve their engagement, motivation and achievement of desired results. In this study, we present a machine learning approach to predict the final student grade from information available in the middle of the course, in the context of introductory programming courses for primary and high school students. We define and extract suitable features from the raw data and use a decision tree classifier to produce a compact set of rules, which are both accurate and interpretable by teachers and students. The decision tree rules provide insights about the important factors for success and highlight key programming tasks that predict the final student performance.
Predicting Student Performance Using Educational Data Mining;"Eleyan, Nehal; Al Akasheh, Mariam; Malik, Esraa Faisal; Hujran, Omar";2022;2022 NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL NETWORKS ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT AND SECURITY, SNAMS;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/SNAMS58071.2022.10062500;;;;Yes;Data mining methods have been employed successfully in several industries, including education, where they are known as educational data mining methods. Educational data mining aims to extract in-depth knowledge from raw data to build automated systems that could be used in the educational sector. With the advancement of data mining technologies, it is now possible to mine educational data to enhance educational practices. This study, therefore, uses educational data mining techniques to predict the final grades of secondary school students. This study has employed several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as classification trees, regression trees, logistic Regression, and Multiple Regression. In addition, the R programming language was used to develop the prediction models. The dataset used in this study was obtained from two secondary schools in Portugal. According to the findings, classification trees and logistic Regression fared better than regression trees and multiple Regression.
RAPID: Engaging High School Youth in Algorithmic Justice Through Audits of Designed and Everyday Machine Learning Applications;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications have led to nation-wide calls for supporting youth in the development of artificial intelligence literacy, competencies needed to effectively interact with and critically evaluate artificial intelligence. Most importantly, a broader range of youths must be equipped to understand how these technologies work, their personal and social impacts, and how they may increase or undermine equity. There is an urgent need for research on youth's understanding of AI in everyday contexts that permeate their daily lives, such as interaction with voice assistants or social media applications. In this project high school-aged youth will learn artificial intelligence and machine learning with a focus on the concept of algorithm auditing, a method for understanding an AI algorithm's opaque inner workings by repeatedly querying the AI system in order to interpret its external effects and impacts. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Researchers will carry out a one-year study involving high school youth designing everyday machine learning applications for their peers, and collaboratively conducting algorithm audits with a focus on algorithm fairness, accountability, and justice. The following research questions will be examined: (1) What are high school youths' current experiences and understandings of everyday machine learning applications? (2) How do high school youth design and conduct collaborative audits of machine learning applications? And (3) How can high school youth apply algorithm auditing approaches to applications they encounter in their everyday lives? To answer these research questions, groups of diverse high school youth from Philadelphia, including Black, Hispanics and Latinos young people, will work in teams and participate in extended workshops to design and collaboratively audit a variety of machine learning applications with text, sound, and images. Using a combination of co-design, interviews, and observational methods, researchers will gain insights into the feasibility of algorithm audits by youth who are some of these systems' most common users; the dynamics of collaborative interactions for productive end-user algorithm audits; and youth understandings of algorithmic justice through auditing. Previous end-user algorithm auditing research has focused only on non-expert adults. The insights gained about youth's approaches to algorithm audits will generate new knowledge, and also have the potential to inform other artificial intelligence and machine learning literacy efforts. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
The effects of high school teacher training on teachers' personal teaching efficacy;"Seok, Jinmyoung; ???; ???; ???";2024;School Mathematics;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;This paper studies the effects and causal mechanism of teacher training in the high school course from 2021 on efficacy. We apply the theory of causal inference developed by Pearl, J. as a method for identifying causal mechanism. Based on previous studies, we search for variables that affect the treatment and outcome variables and draw a directed acyclic graph to confirm the effects among the whole sample.Moreover, we infer the causal mechanism by analyzing the differences in effects among the subgroups of the whole sample space. Based on this study, we suggest implications for teacher training in the course.
Research of Scratch Programming Recommendation System Based on MED and Knowledge Graph;"He Yan-ting; Guo Ben-Jun; Lu Jun; Xu Yuan-ping; Gong Mei";2020;2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL, CONTROL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING (ICMCCE 2020);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ICMCCE51767.2020.00469;;;;Yes;In recent years, children's programming education and primary and secondary school programming education are gradually gaining importance. After the State Council issued relevant documents on the development of artificial intelligence, the status of programming education for primary and secondary schools has been improved. At the same time, in order to improve learning efficiency, it is especially important to build a personalized programming topic recommendation system that takes into account the differences in learning ability and learning characteristics of different learners. This paper introduces a knowledge graph based on the traditional recommendation method, divides a single program block in Scratch programming into several knowledge points that are related to each other, processes the strings and calculates the editing distances according to the topics, finds out the similarities between the topics, combines the difficulty of the topics and knowledge points, and then designs a personalized recommendation system for Scratch programming topics based on the editing distances and knowledge graphs based on the learners' historical answer data, which effectively improves the recommendation accuracy.
The Effects of Instructional Design for High School Mathematics Class Using Artificial Intelligence Applications: Focusing on Academic Achievement and Affective Area;"Oh, Seokhwan; Hyeonjin, Kim";2021;Journal of Korean Association for Educational Information and Media;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;As artificial intelligence (AI) technology is being researched in the field of education, it is leading various changes from national policies to classrooms. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the results of instructional design using AI applications in high school mathematics classes have improved students' academic achievements and affective areas. the experimental group and the control group were selected for four 2nd grade high school classes (98 students). The experimental group conducted a customized class using AI over 10 sessions, and AI adaptively presented questions according to the individual learning process, responded to student questions, and replaced some of the roles of the teacher. The academic achievement and the affective area were measured before and after the experiment, and interviews were conducted. The results of the study, which analyzed the effects of academic achievement, affective domain, and interview after experimental classes, are as follows. First, AI-based customized classes had a positive effect on students' academic achievement. As a result of the students’ interviews, the process of recommending suitable problems in customized classes through AI was effective and efficient. On the other hand, specific feedback was limited. Second, customized classes using AI did not have a significant effect on students' emotional areas. However, the results of the interview showed satisfaction and interest through customized classes using AI. As a result of the study, while confirming the potential of using customized classes using AI, it was suggested that careful design of classes taking into account limited technology is necessary.
Counter-factual Analysis of On-Line Math Tutoring Impact on Low-income High School Students;"Alhossaini, Maher; Aloqeely, Mohammed";2021;20TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA 2021);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00174;;;;Yes;The importance of understanding on-line tutoring impact has increased dramatically, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, deep causal concepts about on-line tutoring are still lacking, especially on economically disadvantaged students. This paper is an observational study that targets low-income high school students in Saudi Arabia with high failing risk. The paper aims at (1) finding on-line math tutoring impact on needy students who already took tutoring, and (2) identifying and characterizing students that need tutoring to pass. We use observational data collected in a student registration process to build two models: (1) a Bayesian multi-level regression causal model, then (2) a counter-factual model. Results show that the models gave statistically significant estimates. In model 1, the average causal impact of maximum tutoring minutes on the math mark was +4.9 (out of 100). In model 2, the counter-factual maximum impact on tutored students was +5.3. We also estimate that only 1.9% of students needed the tutoring to avoid failing (2.8% of the enrolled), and we show their characteristics.
Alternatives to math placement exams: A look at discriminant analysis, neural networks, and ensembles of networks;"Sheel, SJ; Renner, RS; Dawsey, SK";2000;IC-AI'2000: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL 1-III;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Implementing a technique that is efficient yet accurate for college student placement into the appropriate mathematics course is of significant importance. Universities often assign students to entry-level mathematics courses bared on mathematics placement examination scores. In this paper, the authors examine alternative placement strategies. Using multiple regression analysis, the accumulative high school grade point average, mathematics SAT, and the final grade in Algebra II were found to be the best predictors of success on a mathematics placement examination. Using these features, entry-level mathematics placement based on neural networks is contrasted with discriminant analysis, and proposed as an alternative to testing. Results demonstrate neural networks outperform classical discriminant analysis in predicting the recommended mathematics placement. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest ensembles of networks may provide additional benefits. Consequently, a trained neural network or ensemble of networks can be an effective alternative to a written mathematics placement test.

Machine Learning Model for Recommending Suitable Courses of Study to Candidates in Nigerian Universities;"Aliyu, Garba; Haruna, Usman; Abdulmumin, Idris; Isma'il, Murtala; Umar, Ibrahim Enesi; Adamu, Shehu";2021;COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT IX;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-87013-3_20;;;;Yes;The diversity of courses and complications of admission requirements are complex tasks particularly in Nigerian Universities where a number of parameters are used during the admission process. These courses may be wrongly assigned to applicants who have not met the minimum requirements. In a previous related work, a model was developed to address this issue. However, the model considered only seven subjects out of the mandatory nine subjects required of every senior secondary school student to register (O'Level). Such a decision may be to the detriment to the candidates because credits may be required from those subjects that were not considered. This paper tends to enhance the existing model to address all these issues. Grade of nine Secondary school subjects, the aggregate score of Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and post-UTME, and catchment area are used as parameters in this study. The results were obtained when various reference classifiers were trained and tested using the processed dataset of the O'Level and JAMB results of candidates seeking admission into the university. Individual classifiers namely, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest were trained and evaluated using reference performance metrics namely precision, recall, and f1-score. The resulting best classifier, the Random Forest, has shown to be correct 94.94% of the time and is capable of detecting correctly 94.17% of the classes. Since the precision and recall are similar in value, the f1-score tends to favor this classifier also with a value of 93.19%.
Enhanced Student Admission Procedures at Universities Using Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques;"Assiri, Basem; Bashraheel, Mohammed; Alsuri, Ala";2024;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app14031109;;;;Yes;The progress of technology has played a crucial role in enhancing various fields such as education. Universities in Saudi Arabia offer free education to students and follow specific admission policies. These policies usually focus on features and scores such as the high school grade point average, general aptitude test, and achievement test. The main issue with current admission policies is that they do not fit with all majors, which results in high rates of failure, dropouts, and transfer. Another issue is that all mentioned features and scores are cumulatively calculated, which obscures some details. Therefore, this study aims to explore admission criteria used in Saudi Arabian universities and the factors that influence students' choice of major. First, using data mining techniques, the research analyzes the relationships and similarities between the university's grade point average and the other student admission features. The study proposes a new Jaccard model that includes modified Jaccard and approximated modified Jaccard techniques to match the specifications of students' data records. It also uses data distribution analysis and correlation coefficient analysis to understand the relationships between admission features and student performance. The investigation shows that relationships vary from one major to another. Such variations emphasize the weakness of the generalization of the current procedures since they are not applicable to all majors. Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of hidden details such as high school course grades. Second, this study employs machine learning models to incorporate additional features, such as high school course grades, to find suitable majors for students. The K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine algorithms were used to classify students into appropriate majors. This process significantly improves the enrolment of students in majors that align with their skills and interests. The results of the experimental simulation indicate that the K-nearest neighbor algorithm achieves the highest accuracy rate of 100%, while the decision tree algorithm's accuracy rate is 81% and the support vector machine algorithm's accuracy rate is 75%. This encourages the idea of using machine learning models to find a suitable major for applicants.
RAPID: DRL AI: A Career-Driven AI Educational Program in Smart Manufacturing for Underserved High-school Students in the Alabama Black Belt Region;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into advanced manufacturing has promising potential to revolutionize productivity and generate new jobs in smart manufacturing. There is an urgent need to investigate what to teach and how to teach AI in order to prepare future workforce with the necessary AI skills, as most K-12 educators and schools lack the knowledge and experience to teach students AI skills for smart manufacturing. This project will initiate an age-appropriate career-driven AI educational program for high-school students and evaluate its effectiveness. Education researchers will develop manufacturing specific AI learning modules to teach high school students about Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), the most accessible additive manufacturing (AM) process, that will be equipped with automatic real-time process monitoring, analysis and communication. Fifty rising high-school students from underserved school districts across the Black Belt region and rural low-income areas of Alabama, where 52.2% are African Americans and the median household annual income is $27,130, will be recruited to participate in a one-week summer camp. This AI in smart manufacturing education program will employ project-based learning to stimulate broader career interest among a diverse range of students. The proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The goal of the project is investigating age-appropriate equitable AI learning and inclusive teaching in the context of smart manufacturing. The research plan includes: (1) identify AI knowledge and skills required in smart manufacturing for high-school students; (2) experiment with project-based learning (PBL) pedagogy to prepare students to explore smart manufacturing and provide professional training in AI and smart manufacturing for teachers; (3) use a mixed method design with qualitative interview and worksheet data as well as quantitative pre-post knowledge assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed AI educational intervention. In addition to the fifty underserved students, ten high-school teachers will be recruited to receive a three-day intensive professional training before the student summer camp and will facilitate the summer camp activities. These teachers will also develop a lesson plan for continuing the AI educational intervention at their respective schools. The resulting deliverables include the AI learning modules and the smart manufacturing centered PBL pedagogy. The experimental process in developing this AI intervention can be adapted for other AI educational efforts for underserved high schools. The insights gained on the effectiveness of the proposed AI educational intervention will provide valuable lessons for advancing age-appropriate, future career-oriented, and equitable AI education across different K-12 AI educational programs. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Analysis of Recognition and Needs for Parents in Elementary, Middle, and High Schools for Mathematics Education;"Ju, Lee Hyeung; Hyeongsik, Kim; Ko, Ho Kyoung";2021;Communications of Mathematical Education;research-article;WoS;10.7468/jksmee.2021.35.3.213;;;;Yes;This study is intended to investigate contents related to parents' perception and satisfaction level of school mathematics curriculum. Based on the results, this study intended to deduce implications for mathematics education in schools, child education, and parent education. According to the result of the survey, the more positively the parents perceived the value of the mathematics learning, the more positively the child perceived, and the higher the parent's participation rate in mathematics-related education was. In terms of perception of teaching and learning activities, it showed that the willingness to participate in educational programs was lower for the parents of middle and high school students than the parents of elementary school students and the parents of elementary school students also showed higher satisfaction level of school mathematics curriculum. parents have perceived the necessity of teaching and mathematics education to develop artificial intelligence or data analysis skills. It was also found that the parents of middle and high school students’ participation experience in education had an effect on the satisfaction level of their children's math teacher's class preparedness. Parents perceived positively to how pragmatic mathematics curriculum can be and provided answers to what they wish in specific mathematics classes in learning methods and future mathematics learning. As this is for educational experts to consider much in-depth in the future, this study suggested the need for diverse parents’ education related to mathematics including the expansion of mathematics education with parents’ participation, the creation of a mathematics learning environment for future mathematics learning.
A Multimodal Platform to Teach Mathematics to Students with Vision-Impairment;"Jariwala, Abhishek; Marghitu, Daniela; Chapman, Richard";2021;UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION. ACCESS TO MEDIA, LEARNING AND ASSISTIVE ENVIRONMENTS, UAHCI 2021, PT II;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-78095-1_10;;;;Yes;The advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the last decade have led many developers, universities, and researchers to invest in the research and development of digital teaching platforms. This paper compares existing features implemented in the first prototype and provides visually impaired high-school students with a system to learn and practice mathematical problems. This project describes possibilities provided by open-source APIs such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and shows how to implement them to make education universal and accessible. We aim to achieve this by introducing an open-source platform, which will provide a set of modules for personalized speech recognition and accessible online tutoring. The system is divided into two modules: First, an intelligent conversational agent to help students learn new mathematical concepts, which opens up possibilities of providing students with a personalized response. Second, a mathematical expression parser and evaluator to help the student practice mathematical questions. The implementation and development of the system shall open doors towards self-directed learning for visually impaired students.
Predicting Dropout in Higher Education based on Secondary School Performance;"Nagy, Marcell; Molontay, Roland";2018;2018 IEEE 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ENGINEERING SYSTEMS (INES 2018);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Predicting student performance, preventing failure and identifying the factors influencing student dropout are issues that have attracted a great deal of research interest recently. In this study, we employ and evaluate several machine learning algorithms to identify students at-risk and predict student dropout of university programs based on the data available at the time of enrollment (secondary school performance, personal details). We also present a data-driven decision support platform for education directorate and stakeholders.The models are built on data of 15,825 undergraduate students from Budapest University of Technology and Economics enrolled between 2010 and 2017 and finished their undergraduate studies either by graduation or dropping out. We handle the problem of missing data by imputation. After performing feature extraction and feature selection, a wide range of classifiers have been trained including Decision Tree-based algorithms, Naive Bayes, k-NN, Linear Models and Deep Learning with different input settings. The methods were tested using 10-fold cross-validation and the AUC of the best models, Gradient Boosted Trees and Deep Learning, were 0.808 and 0.811 respectively.
AN INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS IN SECONDARY EDUCATION;"Essinger, Steven D.; Rosen, Gail L.";2011;2011 IEEE DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP AND IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING EDUCATION WORKSHOP (DSP/SPE);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;We have developed a platform for exposing high school students to machine learning techniques for signal processing problems, making use of relatively simple mathematics and engineering concepts. Along with this platform we have created two example scenarios which give motivation to the students for learning the theory underlying their solutions. The first scenario features a recycling sorting problem in which the students must setup a system so that the computer may learn the different types of objects to recycle so that it may automatically place them in the proper receptacle. The second scenario was motivated by a high school biology curriculum. The students are to develop a system that learns the different types of bacteria present in a pond sample. The system will then group the bacteria together based on similarity. One of the key strengths of this platform is that virtually any type of scenario may be built upon the concepts conveyed in this paper. This then permits student participation from a wide variety of educational motivation.
Early Prediction of At-Risk Students in Secondary Education: A Countrywide K-12 Learning Analytics Initiative in Uruguay;"Queiroga, Emanuel Marques; Batista Machado, Matheus Francisco; Paragarino, Virginia Rodes; Primo, Tiago Thompsen; Cechinel, Cristian";2022;INFORMATION;Article;WoS;10.3390/info13090401;;;;Yes;This paper describes a nationwide learning analytics initiative in Uruguay focused on the future implementation of governmental policies to mitigate student retention and dropouts in secondary education. For this, data from a total of 258,440 students were used to generate automated models to predict students at risk of failure or dropping out. Data were collected from primary and secondary education from different sources and for the period between 2015 and 2020. Such data contains demographic information about the students and their trajectories from the first grade of primary school to the second grade of secondary school (e.g., student assessments in different subjects over the years, the amount of absences, participation in social welfare programs, and the zone of the school, among other factors). Predictive models using the random forest algorithm were trained, and their performances were evaluated with F1-Macro and AUROC measures. The models were planned to be applied in different periods of the school year for the regular secondary school and for the technical secondary school ((before the beginning of the school year and after the first evaluation meeting for each grade). A total of eight predictive models were developed considering this temporal approach, and after an analysis of bias considering three protected attributes (gender, school zone, and social welfare program participation), seven of them were approved to be used for prediction. The models achieved outstanding performances according to the literature, with an AUROC higher than 0.90 and F1-Macro higher than 0.88. This paper describes in depth the characteristics of the data gathered, the specifics of data preprocessing, and the methodology followed for model generation and bias analysis, together with the architecture developed for the deployment of the predictive models. Among other findings, the results of the paper corroborate the importance given in the literature of using the previous performances of the students in order to predict their future performances.
Learning Mathematical Concepts and Computational Thinking through Explainable Artificial Intelligence in a Simulation-based Learning Environment;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;As a result of the powerful innovation and application of computing in STEM disciplines, the STEM+C program supports research and development of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to the integration of computing within STEM teaching and learning for preK-12 students in both formal and informal settings. This project will advance the integration of the education of math within the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking skills for high school students. AI has become ubiquitous in our everyday lives. From virtual assistants, to self-driving cars, from diagnosing disease, to building houses, many of today's students will go on to work in fields that involve or are influenced by AI. Being proficient in the language of AI is key to a workforce that will be able to continue to innovate and to support the AI-powered technology infrastructure and eco-system. AI builds on the foundation of mathematics. By illustrating how math concepts can be used in powerful AI tools to solve computational problems, learning math through AI and computation can be a motivational and educational vehicle to illustrate the pathway from K-12 STEM education, to post-secondary STEM education, and later to STEM careers. Most of the AI decision-making process today is a black box to non-AI experts, and even to some AI experts. Recent advances in explainable AI, an emerging intelligent human-computer interface that makes the decision-making of AI algorithms transparent to users, creates an opportunity to make AI machine learning concepts accessible to high school students. This proposed project employs explainable AI within a simulation-based learning environment where students follow guided human-robot team explorations to learn how to create abstractions of a problem, utilize AI algorithms to automate the process of solution generation, analyze the outcome, and then improve the performance of their solution. Researchers will iteratively introduce challenge problems and scenarios to encourage students to modify the robot's decision-making where students diagnose, revise, test and analyze, and create new capabilities for the robot. The proposed project partners with three high schools from Virginia and California. The integrated learning content will be developed with high school teachers, focusing on the connections between high school math, AI and computational thinking skills. The proposed project aims to answer the question of to what extent interactive explainable AI design choices and explanations contribute to understanding of math and AI in a use-create-modify framework for high school learners. Research studies will address (1) assessment of the use-create-modify approach and its impact on self-efficacy for computational thinking and use of AI, (2) assessment of understanding of math and AI, and the different uses of explanations to promote learning, and (3) enjoyment and engagement with the human-robot simulation, and to what extent enactment in this human-technology interactive learning environment is able to frame high school level learning of math and its integration with computational thinking. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Improve the Accuracy of Students Admission at Universities Using Machine Learning Techniques;"Assiri, Basem; Bashraheel, Mohammed; Alsuri, Ala";2022;2022 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS (CDMA 2022);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/CDMA54072.2022.00026;;;;Yes;The advancement of technology contributes in the development of many field of life. One of the major fields to focus on is the field of higher education. Actually, Saudi's universities provide free education to the students, so large number of students apply to the universities. In response to that, universities usually maintain admission policies. Universities' admission policies and procedures focus on students Grade Point Average in high school (GPAH), General Aptitude Test (GAT) and Achievement Test (AT). In fact, guiding students to the suitable major improves students' achievements and success. This paper studies the admission criteria for universities in Saudi Arabia. This paper investigates the hidden details that lies behind students' GPAH, GAT and AT. Those details influence the process of students' major selection at universities. Indeed, this research uses machine learning models to include more features such as the grades of high school courses to predict the suitable majors for the students. We use K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify students into suitable majors. This process enhances the enrollments of applicants in appropriate majors. Furthermore, the experiments show that KNN gives the highest accuracy rate as it reaches 100%, while DT's accuracy rate is 81% and SVM's accuracy rate is 75%.
Enhancing Vocational Guidance with Machine Learning: Predicting STEM Career Viability for High School Students;"Moreno-Novoa, Melissa; Puertas, Edwin; Carlos Martinez-Santos, Juan";2024;ADVANCES IN COMPUTING, CCC 2024, PT II;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-75236-0_12;;;;Yes;The decision to pursue a professional career is paramount for young people. Yet, the absence of adequate guidance can result in misguided choices. In Colombia, most high school students need a clearer understanding of their future career aspirations. This lack of clarity often leads to a significant dropout rate at the university level. Furthermore, students entering university tend to consider something other than STEM careers, which could result in a mismatch between their labor skills and future economic needs. To address this issue, we apply machine learning, data mining, and utilizing information from tests such as Saber 11 and the Gardner test, which aim to predict viability within their capabilities oriented toward STEM careers. Applying machine learning models such as XGBoost, Stacking, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and KNN has shown promising results, albeit with challenges in balancing precision and recall for different classes. These advancements represent an opportunity to enhance vocational guidance and increase the likelihood of success and job satisfaction among young people.
Interdisciplinary K-12 Control Education in Biomedical and Public Health Applications;"Duncan, Dominique; Garner, Rachael; Bennett, Alexis; Sinclair, Michael; Ramirez-de la Cruz, Glendy; Pasik-Duncan, Bozenna";2022;IFAC PAPERSONLINE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.286;;;Yes;Yes;There is a lack of control education at the K-12 level, and introducing high school students to the wide range of control applications and methods needed for these problems will increase the number of students who later plan to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and control research or careers. Through our established partnerships with schools in California and Kansas, we have developed educational tools to positively influence the learning and career paths of young high school (HS) students from underserved districts and underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Through the development of new curricula, teaching modules, and shared resources that are made broadly available to other school districts, this work has the potential to impact a large number of K-12 teachers and students. We have been working to train HS teachers to create connections between the STEM subjects they teach students with advanced topics, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that are often taught only post-HS. It creates a context where students can see how their STEM skills can be applied and a pathway of continuing STEM education from secondary to post-secondary. As a result, there is the potential to improve student interest and self-efficacy in STEM and to encourage them to pursue STEM careers. Furthermore, AI is key to understanding and making use of data and solving many control problems. We aim to help students learn the fundamentals of how AI algorithms are applied in contemporary neuroscience. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors.

Large-scale experiment in STEM education for high school students using artificial intelligence kit based on computer vision and Python;"Lohakan, Meechai; Seetao, Choochat";2024;HELIYON;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31366;;;Yes;Yes;This study proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) kit for high school students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The AI kit includes an edge AI machine and electronic components. A compact, purpose-built kit resembling a laptop was designed for ease of replication and portability. Utilizing pre-trained convolutional neural network models and computer vision algorithms, five Thai schools participated in on-site instructions. A quasiexperimental study assessed the students' learning outcomes using a paired sample t-test. Results revealed improved knowledge and reduced score variation. Additionally, gender analysis confirmed that both male and female students met the learning criteria. The students expressed satisfaction with the distinctive hardware and learning method employed during the class activities. Notably, the test results demonstrated that the AI kit enhanced students' enthusiasm and facilitated comprehension.
Professional development needs of teachers managing self-guided learning;Weber, W;2003;INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE TEACHER OF THE FUTURE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;In the project 'Self-guided Learning in Teaching Mathematics at Senior High School Level' (SelMa), five authoring schools are working out scenarios, media and materials for phases of self-guided learning, which will be tested systematically by 10 trial schools with regard to their everyday suitability. In this paper three approaches to such learning arrangements (independent learning centre, jigsaw classroom and learning at stations) are being outlined and relevant experiences are being made available. Learning diaries prove to be useful for the learners' reflections on their learning processes. The adaptation of such learning arrangements and media to a specific learning group does place new demands on the teachers. In addition, diagnosing and consulting in connection with the individual learning processes require new, or enhanced competencies on the part of the teachers who, in spite of having made available more freedom within the framework of teaching, still cannot make adequate use of their enhanced role. Possibilities for further development are outlined.
Self-paced Graph Memory Network for Student GPA Prediction and Abnormal Student Detection;"Yun, Yue; Dai, Huan; Cao, Ruoqi; Zhang, Yupei; Shang, Xuequn";2021;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION (AIED 2021), PT II;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-78270-2_74;;;;Yes;Student learning performance prediction (SLPP) is a crucial step in high school education. However, traditional methods fail to consider abnormal students. In this study, we organized every student's learning data as a graph to use the schema of graph memory networks (GMNs). To distinguish the students and make GMNs learn robustly, we proposed to train GMNs in an easy-to-hard process, leading to self-paced graph memory network (SPGMN). SPGMN chooses the lowdifficult samples as a batch to tune the model parameters in each training iteration. This approach not only improves the robustness but also rearranges the student sample from normal to abnormal. The experiment results show that SPGMN achieves a higher prediction accuracy and more robustness in comparison with traditional methods. The resulted student sequence reveals the abnormal student has a different pattern in course selection to normal students.
State-level population estimates of sexual minority adolescents in the United States: A predictive modeling study;"Ferstad, Johannes O.; Aslam, Maria; Wang, Li Yan; Henaghan, Katherine; Zhao, Jiayi; Li, Jingjing; Salomon, Joshua A.";2024;PLOS ONE;Article;WoS;10.1371/journal.pone.0304175;;;;Yes;Purpose The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) among high school students includes standard questions about sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts, but these questions are not consistently included in every state that conducts the survey. This study aimed to develop and apply a method to predict state-level proportions of high school students identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) or Reporting any same-sex sexual contacts in those states that did not include these questions in their 2017 YRBS.Methods We used state-level high school YRBS data from 2013, 2015, and 2017. We defined two primary outcomes relating to self-Reported LGB identity and Reported same-sex sexual contacts. We developed machine learning models to predict the two outcomes based on other YRBS variables, and comparing different modeling approaches. We used a leave-one-out cross-validation approach and Report results from best-performing models.Results Modern ensemble models outperformed traditional linear models at predicting state-level proportions for the two outcomes, and we identified prediction methods that performed well across different years and prediction tasks. Predicted proportions of respondents Reporting LGB identity in states that did not include direct measurement ranged between 9.4% and 12.9%. Predicted proportions of respondents Reporting any same-sex contacts, where not directly observed, ranged between 7.0% and 10.4%.Conclusion Comparable population estimates of sexual minority adolescents can raise awareness among state policy makers and the public about what proportion of youth may be exposed to disparate health risks and outcomes associated with sexual minority status. This information can help decision makers in public health and education agencies design, implement and evaluate community and school interventions to improve the health of LGB youth.
Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;PROJECT SUMMARYUnderstanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and thepublic alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generationof neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to betoo difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students andteachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots withcameraeyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kitwill allow students to investigate meaningful realworld questions about mind, brain and behavior by designingartificial brains that make the robot’s behavior lifelike, sensoryguided and goaldirected. In Phase I of thisproject, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” bydesigning neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in theclassroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neuronson a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that driveslearning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understandingof neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, anddevelop important computational thinking skills and selfconception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we willdevelop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluatea short highschool instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate thefeasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach highschool neuroscience. Our uniquecombination of lowcost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easytouse applications makes ourproduct appealing to our large highschool, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we willexpand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where studentsand teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our longterm aim is to encourage education policymakers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organizedaround brainbased neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology,medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a projectbased approach to learning,our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEMeducation and inspire the next generation of scientists,engineers and physicians.

Predicting Student Academic Performance: A Comparison of Two Meta-Heuristic Algorithms Inspired by Cuckoo Birds for Training Neural Networks;"Chen, Jeng-Fung; Hsieh, Ho-Nien; Quang Hung Do";2014;ALGORITHMS;Article;WoS;10.3390/a7040538;;;;Yes;Predicting student academic performance with a high accuracy facilitates admission decisions and enhances educational services at educational institutions. This raises the need to propose a model that predicts student performance, based on the results of standardized exams, including university entrance exams, high school graduation exams, and other influential factors. In this study, an approach to the problem based on the artificial neural network (ANN) with the two meta-heuristic algorithms inspired by cuckoo birds and their lifestyle, namely, Cuckoo Search (CS) and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm (COA) is proposed. In particular, we used previous exam results and other factors, such as the location of the student's high school and the student's gender as input variables, and predicted the student academic performance. The standard CS and standard COA were separately utilized to train the feed-forward network for prediction. The algorithms optimized the weights between layers and biases of the neuron network. The simulation results were then discussed and analyzed to investigate the prediction ability of the neural network trained by these two algorithms. The findings demonstrated that both CS and COA have potential in training ANN and ANN-COA obtained slightly better results for predicting student academic performance in this case. It is expected that this work may be used to support student admission procedures and strengthen the service system in educational institutions.
Using Learning Analytics to Improve Students' Enrollments in Higher Education;"Sghir, Nabila; Adadi, Amina; El Mouden, Zakariyaa Ait; Lahmer, Mohammed";2022;2022 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN APPLIED SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY (IRASET'2022);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;"In the last years there has been a growing interest in adopting learning analytics (LA) in higher and further education systems. LA assists the institutional stakeholders to enhance the learning process, ameliorate the teaching activities, make adequate decisions and take appropriate actions based on the collection, analysis, and Reporting of data generated from individual learners. The learning analytics approach aims to achieve many objectives, one of them is prediction which is the center of this research. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study between three machine learning algorithms; Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM); to predict the stream of new enrollments in the first year of higher education. As a case study, the predictive model is applied to new enrollments in the first year of the University Diploma of Technology (DUT) at the Higher School of Technology in Meknes, Morocco (ESTM). The performance of the classifiers is tested with and without the use of SMOTE data balancing on a dataset of 53554 students collected between 2016 and 2019. The obtained results show the best algorithm to predict the most accurate enrollments of students."
An Analysis on Secondary Mathematics Teachers' Perceptions of AI-Convergence Education;"Yoo, Yeo Kyung; Chung, Jae Young";2024;The Journal of Learner-Centered Curriculum and Instruction;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;Objectives The purpose of this study is to determine the level of awareness of secondary school mathematics teachers on the use of AI in mathematics education and the use of AI in various stages of lesson design.Methods A survey was conducted among 126 math teachers working in secondary schools. To analyze the survey results, the frequency, mean value, and standard deviation of each question were analyzed. In addition, independent samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were conducted to check the significance of differences in respondents' characteristics as needed.Results The main findings of the study are as follows First, the results of the chi-square test were used to determine the statistical significance of whether the respondents had experience in teaching using A.I. Second, the chi-square test was used to determine whether the respondents had experience in teaching using A.I. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in age and teaching experience, and the higher the age and teaching experience, the more teachers who had experience in teaching using A.I.. Third, the items that mathematics teachers expect more help from A.I. in lesson design are “diagnosing various learning problems by visualizing learner data (M=4.47),” “analyzing learning data such as learners' learning styles and learning patterns (M=4.4),” and “providing learning materials to overcome learning deficiencies (M=4.37)”. Fourth, when analyzing the perceptions of using AI in each stage of lesson design according to individual characteristics, the female mean (M=4.16) of ‘lesson design and development stage’ was higher than the male mean (M=3.88), and the difference was statistically significant.Conclusions Based on the results of the analysis, the following implications can be drawn for school math classes and lesson design activities. First, it is necessary to develop the professionalism of secondary math teachers so that math education using AI can be introduced and actively applied in the school field. Second, it is necessary to develop and disseminate teaching materials utilizing AI so that math education using AI can be activated. Third, research on AI-based math teaching and learning platforms is needed so that AI can be utilized in each stage of lesson design. Fourth, research and development of automatic grading systems utilizing AI technology should be conducted to support math education.
Exploring the Meaning and Direction of the Operation of the Artificial Intelligence Liberal Arts Curriculum;Kim, Yanghee;2022;The Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial intelligence is one of the key technologies of the 4th industrial revolution, and its importance is being emphasized in the field of education. The purpose of this study is to explore the meaning and direction of the operation of artificial intelligence curriculum at the level of university liberal arts education. In this study, we analyzed educational policies and previous studies related to artificial intelligence, we considered the level standard curriculum 'Mathematics, Data science, and AI Literacy' in Japan and the European 'Elements of AI' curriculum to examine the significance of AI education as a liberal arts education. In addition, in order to understand the current state of operation of the artificial intelligence liberal arts curriculum, we analyzed the opening status of artificial intelligence-related liberal arts subjects and major educational contents of SW-centered universities, which can be said to be leaders in software and artificial intelligence education. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that not only the difference in the number of courses offered by each university was large, but that most of the courses dealt only with content limited to the understanding and use of artificial intelligence technology. Finally, to explore the direction of operation of the liberal arts artificial intelligence curriculum based on the analysis contents, 'sequence with high school curriculum', 'setting the scope of education content', 'applying standard model of university liberal arts education', and 'development of various convergence subjects' and discussed. In 'sequence with the high school curriculum' and 'setting the scope of educational content', which are related to the principle of curriculum development, most students currently go to college without any experience of artificial intelligence learning, so the level and needs of the learners are reflected. It was suggested that the curriculum should be structured and sequence should be strengthened by reflecting changes in the high school curriculum in the future. Next, it was proposed to apply the 'standard model of university liberal arts basic education' to develop the actual liberal arts curriculum. Artificial intelligence education should be faithful to the role of literacy education targeting users as well as future technology developers and operators. In addition, 'various convergence subjects' should be developed and operated to foster creative and convergence talents.
Collaborative Research: RAPID: Integrating Culturally Relevant Project-based AI Learning into High School STEM Education;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The exponential expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has created a significant demand on future AI workforce development. Several key challenges exist hindering the widespread incorporation of AI into K-12 curricula, including the lack of teacher development in AI and a comprehensive pedagogical framework for K-12 AI education. This project aims to engage high-school students from North Dakota and southern Alabama, two geographical areas with large populations from historically marginalized groups, in the learning of AI by implementing and examining a culturally relevant project-based AI-integrated learning framework. The framework connects AI learning with students' learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes, fostering the growth of their interdisciplinary problem-solving skills. To develop students' individual interest in AI, their learning is situated within the context of personal experiences. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project includes two components: (1) training of high-school teachers, and (2) teachers' classroom implementation. Seventeen teachers will participate in small group and individual hands-on practices, immersive workshops, reflection and discussion, and presentations. Researchers will carry out mixed-method design research examining teacher training outcome. With scaffolding and support from researchers, teachers will develop and teach AI-STEM integrated lessons in biology and pre-calculus at their own high schools in North Dakota and southern Alabama. Multimodal data collection and analysis will be used for researching the perceptual, cognitive, and kinesthetic processes about students' problem-solving skills, interdisciplinary knowledge use, and classroom participation, as well as how these processes affect students' STEM and AI learning and interest development. This research has significant potential to contribute to our knowledge on how to effectively support historically marginalized students' interest in and learning of AI. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
e-Learning and Classroom Learning Activities;Jancarik, Antonin;2019;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING (ECEL 2019);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.34190/EEL.19.109;;;;Yes;Systems for e-learning or blended learning support of teaching have become an integral part of teaching process from primary schools to universities. There is an enormous number of various LMS systems and educational programmes. Most available systems offer teaching and learning materials and provide feedback to the teacher - information on results achieved by their students. The paper introduces the Techambition system and its potential and opportunities it provides. The system was designed to support mathematics education on upper secondary schools and has been developed by a British company of the same name. This system is used in mathematics education on dozens of upper secondary schools in the Czech Republic. The number of students who work with it exceeds 10,000. Last year Faculty of Education, Charlese University signed a contract with the company Techambition. Academic staff of Faculty of Education are involved in development of educational content. Unlike other product, the Techambition system offers a brand new function - planning teaching activities. A system of artificial intelligence evaluates students' work and prepares a list of activities for them that the teacher should use in the next lesson. The plan includes both incentives for frontal teaching and proposals for collaborative learning. The system prepares for the teacher not only a set of tasks but also divides the students into groups. When dividing the students into groups, the system uses their characteristics (learning styles, knowledge of the topic, solving procedures used) with the aim of making the group work as effective as possible. Some activities are conducted on-line on computers and having evaluated the results new activities are proposed. The goal of the paper is to introduce the Techambition system as such, the method of designing individual activities as well as pupils' and teachers' experience with using the system. Results show that the use of Al in classroom management and lesson planning has a significant potential and deserves attention of further research.
Two-fold Learning: Learning by Developing and Learning by Playing;"Bralia, Cristina; Catenazzi, Nadia";2008;7TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, VOL 1;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;This paper describes the Learning by playing project, an initiative that involves secondary-school students in the development of didactic software for children of the primary school. This project, started in 200607, is the result of a collaboration between the Istituto Tecnico Commerciale Enrico Tosi (Italy) and eight primary schools.This work has a two-fold didactic objective. On one hand, it aims to motivate secondary-school students to learn the Visual Basic (VB) programming language through the development of didactic games for children. On the other hand, it aims to encourage and support learning and competence acquisition of primary school learners, through the use of the developed interactive games and activities. Didactic software, produced in various disciplines, including mathematics, history, Italian grammar, science, music, and English, is made freely available via Web.As emerged from a preliminary evaluation, the project was successful in reaching the two initial objectives. From the secondary school students point of view, the initiative increased the interest for the VB programming subject as well as to improve their learning outcomes. The presence of a customer represented a strong stimulus for students who had to develop programs to be used in a real context rather than abstract didactic exercises. Many students were so involved in this activity that they proposed improvements and extensions which were not originally foreseen and required them an extra work. In addition, it is worth noting that some students took the initiative to develop brand new games to propose to the primary school teachers.From the primary school point of view, the computer support and the use of multimedia elements contributed to stimulate children interest and motivation. Children can follow their own learning pace, can repeat an exercise as many times as required, can play and compete with another classmate, with positive results for any child, but specifically for foreign children, in terms of learning outcomes.Most of the results Reported above are derived from questionnaires. Additional findings will be collected in the future using other evaluation methods such observation, logging files, task analysis with different samples of users, etc. This would allow a more direct feedback to be obtained for possible improvements.In conclusion, the Learning by Playing experience has demonstrated to be a profitable case of collaboration across grades and across schools.

Third, it is necessary to establish an environment for computational thinking and artificial intelligence education, as well as research and support for it.
AR Tech-DaSH: Arkansas Technology and Data Science in Health and Medicine;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Arkansas Technology and Data Science in Health and medicine (AR Tech-DaSH) is a partnership between theUniversity of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) and high school students and teachers primarily innorthwest (NW) Arkansas. The program targets the underserved and underrepresented population of studentsin NW Arkansas and is structured around technology and data science outreach in the classroom andcommunity as well as statewide virtual classroom outreach and teacher training workshops. The overallobjective is to increase STEM content knowledge and promote more positive beliefs and attitudes towardsSTEM and data science with the ultimate goal of promoting a more diverse STEM workforce. The programrevolves around three major health concerns prevalent in the NW Arkansas regional population (i.e.,cardiovascular, obesity/diabetes, and immunology/cancer). The three specific aims of this project are to: Aim 1.Increase the interest and knowledge of high school students for STEM related fields and careers with a focuson data science. The program uses hands on imaging technology and data science analytic experiences tostimulate student interest in STEM and data science careers. Visits to 9th grade classes at schools in both ruraland urban districts in NW Arkansas will provide students with valuable experience using a variety of medicalrelated technologies (e.g., stethoscopes, ultrasound, infrared, and computerized tomography (CT) imaging)and data science focused activities. A ten-day AR Tech-DaSH camp for 25 students each year will provide anintegrated exposure to medical related skills, anatomical basis of disease, clinician-patient simulations,research and case-based discussions of the three thematic diseases. A major focus of the camp is to providestudents with an exposure to data science skills (exploratory data analysis, data transformation, data mining,and machine learning) using health or medicine related datasets. The camp includes near peer mentoring bymedical and undergraduate students, and lunch panel discussions with STEM role models. High school leveldata science modules will be developed and piloted with select groups of high school students. Aim 2. IncreaseSTEM and data science knowledge in the community. Students who attend camp will be designated as STEMAmbassadors and will design and implement outreach events in their school districts with input from thecommunity stakeholders. The community events will focus on health and medicine and the value of datascience in making important life decisions. Aim 3. Increase student and teacher knowledge of health andmedicine and data science across the state through implementation of a virtual outreach model. Virtualoutreach sessions will be provided to rural classrooms across the state. Virtual teacher training workshops willshow teachers how to incorporate imaging and data science into their classroom curriculum. The successfulimplementation of AR Tech-DaSH will serve as a model for using technology and data science to promoteSTEM in diverse populations to ensure a future STEM workforce that better reflects the US population.
Collaborative Research: Cognitive and Neural Indicators of School-based Improvements in Spatial Problem Solving;;2015;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This project, to be conducted by James Madison University, Georgetown University, and Northwestern University, will examine learning spatial thinking skills by high school students (who are studying geoscience), looking at educational outcomes as well as behavioral and neurological measures. There is already considerable evidence linking spatial ability and future STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) attainment. The project will focus on a high school course, the Geospatial Semester, that is designed to improve spatial thinking. The project will look for changes in patterns of brain activity as a result of the course, as well as relations among the educational, behavioral, and neurological measures. Prior research indicates that spatial training in the laboratory may reduce gender differences in performance; this project will seek to measure this effect in real world high school spatial learning, and to identify neural mechanisms that help explain how and why the gender gap closes. This project will advance the work of the EHR (Education & Human Resources) Directorate in studying the cognitive and neural basis of STEM learning. The overall goal of the project is to develop a mechanistic theory of change for spatial STEM education at the behavioral and neural levels. To achieve this goal, the project will measure a combination of outcomes: educational (e.g., coursework), behavioral (e.g., core spatial ability on standard tests of mental rotation and embedded figure identification, use of spatial language), and neurological (e.g., neural efficiency and grey matter volume in brain regions that support spatial thinking ability, interconnectivity networks across brain regions). Students in the spatially-based Geospatial Semester will be compared to peers receiving standard (non-spatially-based) STEM education in other advanced science courses. Neurological measures will be obtained by functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging performed at pre- and post-test time points. In general, the project will address the issue of brain plasticity in a high school STEM education context. The project will use machine learning techniques to discern neurological effects of spatial learning in both hypoThesis-driven and data-driven ways, and examine gender differences in the effect of spatial STEM learning on cognition and the brain. Analyses will focus on relating changes across neural, behavioral, and educational levels toward an integrated understanding of the mechanisms that make spatial STEM learning effective."

Identify students' conception and level of representations using five-tier test on wave concepts;"Wiyantara, A.; Widodo, A.; Prima, E. C.";2021;INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION (ICMSCE) 2020;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012137;;;;Yes;This study aims to identify students' conception and their level of representation on wave concepts. This is descriptive research. Data were collected through a five-tiers instrument test. Subjects in this study were thirty 9th grades in one of Junior High School in Bandung. The results of the study show that there are many students who lack knowledge and misconceptions. Students' visual representation in wave concepts in real life is only at the macroscopic level. Their drawing in connecting phenomena and real-life also have some errors. Multiple representations-based learning is needed to facilitate students changing their conceptions into scientific and deep conceptions, which not only focus on representations modal such as verbal, picture, mathematic, and graph, but also level of representations, such as macroscopic, microscopic, sub-microscopic and symbolic.
The Construction and Optimization of an AI Education Evaluation Indicator Based on Intelligent Algorithms;"Zeng, Yu; Xu, Xing";2022;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE INFORMATICS AND NATURAL INTELLIGENCE;Article;WoS;10.4018/IJCINI.315275;;;;Yes;The basic tool in the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is the complete judgment matrix. To address the weakness of the AHP in determining weight in the comprehensive evaluation system, the particle swarm optimization (PSO)-AHP model proposed in this paper is based on the PSO in the meta-heuristic algorithm. The model was used to solve the indicator weights in the evaluation system of AI education in primary and secondary schools in Fujian Province and was compared with the genetic algorithm and war strategy optimization algorithm. From the comparison results, the PSO-AHP optimization is more effective among the three algorithms, and the indicator consistency can be improved by about 30%. They are both effective in solving the problem that once the judgment matrix is given in the AHP, the weights and indicator consistency cannot be improved. Finally, the results were tested by Friedman statistics to prove the viability of the proposed algorithm.
Empirical Research on AI Technology-Supported Precision Teaching in High School Science Subjects;"Hao, Miaomiao; Wang, Yi; Peng, Jun";2024;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app14177544;;;Yes;Yes;"The empowerment of educational reform and innovation through AI technology has become a topic of increasing interest in the field of education. The advent of AI technology has made comprehensive and in-depth teaching evaluation possible, serving as a significant driving force for efficient and precise teaching. There were few empirical studies on the application of high-quality precision teaching models in the field of compulsory education, and the learning difficulty of technology and the teaching burden on teachers have become significant factors hindering the use of technology to support education. This study analyzed teaching models from the perspectives of teachers' teaching burdens and students' learning obstacles, and was committed to relying on intelligent technology to construct a new precision teaching model, an educational diagnosis-feedback-intervention path that covered the entire teaching process, from the dimensions of teacher behavior, student behavior, and parent behavior, aiming to assist teachers in efficient teaching and students in personalized learning. This study was conducted with nine science classes, including about 540 people in the second year of high school at a Middle School in China; six classes were the intervention groups while the last three classes were control groups, and a survey of 19 teachers from the intervention classes was carried out. The results showed that this model can significantly improve students' academic performance in science subjects, especially in mathematics and chemistry. It has increased the proportion of high-achieving students, reduced the proportion of low-achieving students, stimulated students' self-directed learning ability, cultivated a positive attitude towards science learning, and explained the key points of using a precision teaching model in different disciplines. It has achieved a deep integration of education and technology, helping to increase the efficiency and reduce the burden of teaching."
A Practical Model for Educators to Predict Student Performance in K-12 Education using Machine Learning;"Harvey, Julie L.; Kumar, Sathish A. P.";2019;2019 IEEE SYMPOSIUM SERIES ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (IEEE SSCI 2019);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Predicting classifiers can be used to analyze data in K-12 education. Creating a classification model to accurately identify factors affecting student performance can be challenging. Much research has been conducted to predict student performance in higher education, but there is limited research in using data science to predict student performance in K-12 education. Predictive models are developed and examined in this review to analyze a K-12 education dataset. Three classifiers are used to develop these predictive models, including linear regression, decision tree, and Naive Bayes techniques. The Naive Bayes techniques showed the highest accuracy when predicting SAT Math scores for high school students. The results from this review of current research and the models presented in this paper can be used by stakeholders of K-12 education to make predictions of student performance and be able to implement intervention strategies for students in a timely manner.
Factors Influencing Tandem Learning in Mathematics;"Bregant, Bor; Doz, Daniel; Hudovernik, Sanela";2025;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION;Article;WoS;10.29333/iji.2025.18124a;;;;Yes;The main objective of secondary education institutions is to provide quality education to its students. One way to achieve this is by introducing various teaching methods, one of which is tandem learning, which is a small-group cooperative learning method. Not everyone responds well to a one-size-fits-all method, and therefore, uncovering insights for predictive model selection tailored to individual students or classrooms becomes imperative for teaching institutions. The knowledge is embedded in the educational data set and is extractable through data mining techniques. The primary objective of the study was to identify the key factors that significantly influence student outcomes (including both emotional well-being and knowledge improvement) in tandem learning using machine learning algorithms. The study was conducted in a mathematics class during the course of one week of tandem learning implementation in the school year 2023/24 with a sample of 89 high school students from a selected Slovene high school and interaction, and whether the student outperformed their partner). The outcome of interest was a three-state dependent variable indicating whether the student responded well to the implementation of tandem learning into the education environment. The present study tested which predictor variables were most important using mutual information and recursive feature elimination for all variables. The most important factors according to mutual information for predicting student response were outperforming the partner, class, and qualitative qualitative interaction, outperforming partner and gender.
Tools for solving problems in the scope of algebraic programming;"Kapitonova, YV; Letichevsky, AA; Lvov, MS; Volkov, VA";1995;INTEGRATING SYMBOLIC MATHEMATICAL COMPUTATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;"Article; Proceedings Paper";WoS;;;;;Yes;Algebraic programming system APS is considered as a tool for integrating computer algebra with artificial intelligence. The system is based on rewriting rule programming and algebraic program in APLAN, the source language of the system, in many cases may be considered as an executable specification of a problem. Two different kinds of solvers are specified in terms of rewriting rules. The first one is a universal solver that extends a pure PROLOG-like solver in different directions. One of the important property of this solver is the possibility for inclusion of special algorithms for solving equations in different algebras. Another solver is directed to solving problems on computational models (some kind of constraint networks). It searches for the solution of a problem in two stages - constructing the plan and solving equations. On the second stage the solver calls the universal one to get the solution of equations. The application of APS and its solvers to the development of system for mathematical education in secondary school is briefly described in the last section of the paper.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up newopportunities for developing individualised learning for students. A 2023 study analyses the results of using artificial intelligence by teachers of Ukrainian secondary schools. The main goal of the survey is to determine the state of AI applications for individualised learning and the integration of this technology into pedagogical practice.The study examines the timing of digital technology implementation and its impact on the continuous development of teachers' digital competencies. Particular attention is paid to the aspects of AI implementation, including educational purposes, teacher readiness, and limitations of this technology.It is established that to implement individualised learning, the goal and objectives of individualisation, the choice of AI services and platforms, opportunities for students, security measures, learning pace, level of mastery of the material and personal interests should be considered. The author proposes a classification of tasks for students using AI and provides examples of assessments for students of grades 7-9 in English, mathematics, and biology. Emphasis is given to the fact that AI-powered automatic assessment enables the recognition of the requirements of every individual student and adapts learning tasks according to their current abilities and knowledge. Despite the challenges and problems of integrating AI into the school environment, the study points to the growing interest of teachers in this technology, the improvement of AI capabilities, and its gradual development as a teacher's assistant.
Incorporation of Polya's Problem Solving into Process Guide Inquiry in Learning Buffer Solution;"Oktaviani, Ni Komang Chika; Prastika, Ari; Fajaroh, Fauziatul; Suharti, Suharti";2020;3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION (ICOMSE) 2019: STRENGTHENING MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH FOR THE CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL SOCIETY;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1063/5.0000692;;;;Yes;POGIL had been shown to be one superior learning model in science education including chemistry education and it match with mandatory learning approach in current Indonesian High school curriculum. The effect of POGIL in learning result was somehow vary in many studied. One problem found in our observation, students were not able to apply their new knowledge at application step of POGIL model. This paper Reports our effort to improve student's cognitive learning outcome in learning buffer solution by modifying POGIL at application step. Buffer solution is one part of chemistry at high school of which students had difficulties in understanding it. In learning buffer, it requires ability in conceptual understanding and algorithmic problem solving. Polya's problem solving method has known as one powerful problem solving model in mathematics. We had modified POGIL by incorporating Polya's problem solving steps at application step of POGIL and implemented the model in learning buffer solution. Although only 50% student passed the school passing grade in experimental class, the modified model seem superior compared to original POGIL. In control class only 16% students passed the school passing grade. The mean rank value in the Maim-Whitney test in the experimental class (46.61) was higher than the control class (26.39). Therefore, modified POGIL was proven to be better model in learning buffer solution. This study was done in a short period of learning buffer solution. In order to get higher cognitive outcome in learning chemistry, longer observation must be carried out until students accustom with the modified POGIL.
Students' perceptions of Artificial Intelligence Technology and Artificial Intelligence Teachers;"JONGHYANG, PARK; Namin, Shin?";2017;The Journal of Korean Teacher Education;research-article;WoS;10.24211/tjkte.2017.34.2.169;;;;Yes;"Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerged as a critical technology that can lead the so-called fourth industry revolution. In exploring the relationship between AI and future education, this study attempted to identify students' perceptions of AI technology and AI playing the role of teachers at school. We used student data collected from a survey administered to 6 schools located in Seoul and Kyunggi area. Research participants are those students enrolled in elementary (337), middle (234) and high schools (178) in May, 2016, whose average age was 12.9 (MD=2.964). Research questions were developed around three themes: students' perceptions of AI, AI and student learning and AI teachers. Both statistical and contents analysis methods were used for analyzing the survey data. The results of the data analysis were following: First, there was a significant difference between elementary and middle/high school students' with regard to the perceptions of AI technology: elementary students tended to see AI as a 'convenient technology' while the majority of middle and high school students responded that 'it depends on users'; Second, students' perceptions of AI as a tool for supporting their learning included 'customized learning support', 'provision of structured learning contents', and 'kind tutoring'. Third, 59.8% of the respondent students were against the idea of replacing human teachers with AI teachers; and Science, Mathematics, English, and Korean ranked, in the order, as the subjects that AI teachers could deal with whereas roles or subjects such as 'counseling', 'principal', 'caring', 'music', and 'physical education' ranked relatively low. Fourth, as to the appearance of AI teachers, the students liked the 'human-like appearance' most and there was no particular preference about the sex of AI teachers. Fifth, the strengths of AI teachers included 'effective delivery of information and knowledge', 'fair attitude towards students', 'anticipation of having some fun', and 'conveniences brought by using machinery' whereas the students saw the weaknesses of AI teachers as 'having no human-like emotions', 'inappropriate for a certain area of education', and 'negative side effects caused by using machinery'. These results were discussed along with the issues of the application of AI technology to teaching and learning, the role of future teachers, and the design of empathic robots for teaching, etc."
Creative Accessibility in the Era of Artificial Intelligence and Its Applied Technology Research;"Wang, Xianchuang; Fang, Haiguang; Shu, Lili; Li, Zeyu";2024;2024 THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND TEACHER EDUCATION, ICAITE 2024;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1145/3702386.3702400;;;;Yes;In the era of artificial intelligence, an AI dual-teacher classroom environment constructed using technologies such as knowledge graphs, large models, and educational robots will facilitate students in achieving the cognitive goals related to creativity in Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives. The use of artificial intelligence technology, especially large model technology, can promote students' inclination towards creativity and creative thinking. However, it is essential to guide students to engage in deep thinking before designing prompts based on their ideas, thereby fostering their creative and critical thinking through human-machine collaboration. This study takes a certain experimental school as a case to explore the effectiveness of creative accessibility in the AI dual-teacher classroom environment and its application technology in primary and secondary schools.
Applying Machine Learning and SHAP Method to Identify Key Influences on Middle-School Students' Mathematics Literacy Performance;"Huang, Ying; Zhou, Ying; Chen, Jihe; Wu, Danyan";2024;JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE;Article;WoS;10.3390/jintelligence12100093;;;;Yes;The PISA 2022 literacy assessment highlights a significant decline in math performance among most OECD countries, with the magnitude of this decline being approximately three times that of the previous round. Remarkably, Hong Kong, Macao, Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea ranked in the top six among all participating countries or economies, with Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea also demonstrating improved performance. Given the widespread concern about the factors influencing secondary-school students' mathematical literacy, this paper adopts machine learning and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to analyze 34,968 samples and 151 features from six East Asian education systems within the PISA 2022 dataset, aiming to pinpoint the crucial factors that affect middle-school students' mathematical literacy. First, the XGBoost model has the highest prediction accuracy for math literacy performance. Second, 15 variables were identified as significant predictors of mathematical literacy across the student population, particularly variables such as mathematics self-efficacy (MATHEFF) and expected occupational status (BSMJ). Third, mathematics self-efficacy was determined to be the most influential factor. Fourth, the factors influencing mathematical literacy vary among individual students, including the key influencing factors, the direction (positive or negative) of their impact, and the extent of this influence. Finally, based on our findings, four recommendations are proffered to enhance the mathematical literacy performance of secondary-school students.

Collaborative Research: RAPID: Integrating Culturally Relevant Project-based AI Learning into High School STEM Education;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The exponential expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) has created a significant demand on future AI workforce development. Several key challenges exist hindering the widespread incorporation of AI into K-12 curricula, including the lack of teacher development in AI and a comprehensive pedagogical framework for K-12 AI education. This project aims to engage high-school students from North Dakota and southern Alabama, two geographical areas with large populations from historically marginalized groups, in the learning of AI by implementing and examining a culturally relevant project-based AI-integrated learning framework. The framework connects AI learning with students' learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes, fostering the growth of their interdisciplinary problem-solving skills. To develop students' individual interest in AI, their learning is situated within the context of personal experiences. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project includes two components: (1) training of high-school teachers, and (2) teachers' classroom implementation. Seventeen teachers will participate in small group and individual hands-on practices, immersive workshops, reflection and discussion, and presentations. Researchers will carry out mixed-method design research examining teacher training outcome. With scaffolding and support from researchers, teachers will develop and teach AI-STEM integrated lessons in biology and pre-calculus at their own high schools in North Dakota and southern Alabama. Multimodal data collection and analysis will be used for researching the perceptual, cognitive, and kinesthetic processes about students' problem-solving skills, interdisciplinary knowledge use, and classroom participation, as well as how these processes affect students' STEM and AI learning and interest development. This research has significant potential to contribute to our knowledge on how to effectively support historically marginalized students' interest in and learning of AI. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

In this article, we present Gea 2: A New Earth, a digital SG developed as an immersive 3-D virtual learning environment, integrating several educational resources, including multimedia learning material, communication tools, and intelligent tutoring support. The game aims to complement traditional classroom activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), for high school students and teachers. It incorporates an intelligent pedagogical agent that can converse in natural language with the student and provides unsolicited hints during gameplay. This article presents the game and its evaluation based on experiments involving about 100 participants. We think that the results presented here add to the research on game-based learning for STEM, by proposing a complex game system, where artificial intelligence techniques are integrated to support students' learning, and by confirming that the game experience can be attractive for the learners, also in very constrained classroom environments, such as those we operated in.

The ontology is intended to be used as a Linked Open Data hub for mathematical education, a linguistic resource for intelligent mathematical language processing and an end-user reference educational database. The ontology is organized in three layers: a foundational ontology layer, a domain ontology layer and a linguistic layer. The domain ontology layer contains language-independent concepts, covering secondary school mathematics curriculum. The linguistic layer provides linguistic grounding for these concepts, and the foundation ontology layer provides them with meta-ontological annotations. The concepts are organized in two main hierarchies: the hierarchy of objects and the hierarchy of reified relationships. For our knowledge, OntoMath(Edu) is the first Linked Open Data mathematical ontology, that respects ontological distinctions provided by a foundational ontology; represents mathematical relationships as first-oder entities; and provides strong linguistic grounding for the represented mathematical concepts."

Unstructured commentary text related to their real learning experience regarding the learning process is generally published by users to show their opinions and complaints. The article aims to utilize the dataset of real text comments of 10 high school mathematics courses participated by high school students in the Bilibili platform and construct a hybrid algorithm called the Artificial Intelligence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) + Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to crunch data and extract their sentiments. A series of tests regarding algorithm comparison were conducted on the educational review datasets. Comparative analysis found that the proposed algorithm achieves higher precision and lower loss rates than other alternative algorithms. Meanwhile, the loss ratio of the proposed algorithm was kept at a low level. At the topic mining level, the topic clustering of negative comments found that the barrage content was very messy and the complexity of the course content was generally Reported by the students. Some problems related to videos were also mentioned. The outcomes are promising that the fundamental issues underlined by the students can be effectively resolved to improve curriculum and teaching quality.
Predicting the Performance of Mathematics' Students through Data Mining Techniques for Enhanced Education Systems;"Mauricio, Jose; Marques, Goncalo";2021;2021 1ST CONFERENCE ON ONLINE TEACHING FOR MOBILE EDUCATION (OT4ME);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/OT4ME53559.2021.9638819;;;;Yes;In this study, we use data mining techniques to predict the performance of students in mathematics. The failure rate in secondary education within the discipline of mathematics is significant. Therefore, predicting the performance of students is relevant to support the decision plan on interventions. A dataset with 395 records collected from two secondary schools in Portugal was used in this work. The authors tested eight machine learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Consequently, this work supports future research activities to use NB to predict students' performance. Moreover, this work has ranked the impact of the variables which most disturb students from achieving success. The results recommend the NB algorithm using the top five important features which Report 75.22%, 74.41%, 75.22%, and 73,29% of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively. By predicting students' performance is possible to plan interventions on time and, consequently, increase the final discipline score.
Development of Artificial Intelligence Education Program for Convergence Education based on RST Approach;"???; ???; ???";2011;Journal of Knowledge Information Technology and Systems;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;In general, convergence education programs aim to convey a multidisciplinary topic which embraces subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and technology usually acts as an integrator in convergence education programs. In this context, it is pointed out that providing the applications and experiences of advanced technologies is an essential part of the convergence education programs. To achieve the goal of convergence education programs, it is very important to overcome the gap between technology experiences and studying theory, and education programs should provide a clear link from technology experiences to studying theory. On the basis of this strategy, this paper develops an artificial intelligence education program targeted at the middle and high school students.
Predicting Students' State Examination Results based on Previous Grades and Demographics;"Pentel, Avar; Kaiva, Lisanne-Liis";2020;2020 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION, INTELLIGENCE, SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (IISA 2020);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;All Estonia's upper-secondary school students have three mandatory final state examinations - in mathematics, Estonian language and foreign language. We used data obtained from one school in order to predict student's final examination scores based on previous grades and demographic data. Our aim was to find most important factors that contribute positively to final results and vice versa. Machine learning package Weka was used to build predictive models and with all tested attribute sets we got accuracy over 80% on classification. On continuous models we got mean absolute error close or less to 10, when range of test result was 0-100 points. Most of our attributes were subject grades on scale 1-5, and therefore, as we limited our testing sample with one school only, it gave interesting insights into how some subjects and teachers do contribute to final test results. And, surprisingly, it turned out, that for some test result, most significant predictor was negatively correlated to the result. It means that having bad grades in some subjects was a good predictor of success in final test. Besides being a useful tool for students who want to estimate possible test results beforehand, it is also a useful tool for measuring teachers' contributions and relationships between different subjects.
A Machine Learning and Explainable AI Approach for Predicting Secondary School Student Performance;"Hasib, Khan Md; Rahman, Farhana; Hasnat, Rashik; Alam, Md Golam Rabiul";2022;2022 IEEE 12TH ANNUAL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION WORKSHOP AND CONFERENCE (CCWC);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720806;;;;Yes;An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school Reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working.

Analysis of Enrollment Criteria in Secondary Schools Using Machine Learning and Data Mining Approach;"ul Abideen, Zain; Mazhar, Tehseen; Razzaq, Abdul; Haq, Inayatul; Ullah, Inam; Alasmary, Hisham; Mohamed, Heba G. G.";2023;ELECTRONICS;Article;WoS;10.3390/electronics12030694;;;;Yes;Out-of-school children (OSC) surveys are conducted annually throughout Pakistan, and the results show that the literacy rate is increasing gradually, but not at the desired speed. Enrollment campaigns and targets system of enrollment given to the schools required a valuable model to analyze the enrollment criteria better. In existing studies, the research community mainly focused on performance evaluation, dropout ratio, and results, rather than student enrollment. There is a great need to develop a model for analyzing student enrollment in schools. In this proposed work, five years of enrollment data from 100 schools in the province of Punjab (Pakistan) have been taken. The significant features have been extracted from data and analyzed through machine learning algorithms (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree). These algorithms contribute to the future prediction of school enrollment and classify the school's target level. Based on these results, a brief analysis of future registrations and target levels has been carried out. Furthermore, the proposed model also facilitates determining the solution of fewer enrollments in school and improving the literacy rate.
Teaching Plan Generation and Evaluation With GPT-4: Unleashing the Potential of LLM in Instructional Design;"Hu, Bihao; Zheng, Longwei; Zhu, Jiayi; Ding, Lishan; Wang, Yilei; Gu, Xiaoqing";2024;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1109/TLT.2024.3384765;;;;Yes;This study explores and analyzes the specific performance of large language models (LLMs) in instructional design, aiming to unveil their potential strengths and possible weaknesses. Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.

This study aims to examine the relationship between students' demographic characteristics and their academic achievement at the pre-diploma level using machine learning.Design/methodology/approachSecondary data analysis was used in this study, which involved collecting information about 1,052 pre-diploma students enrolled at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Pahang Branch between 2017 and 2021. The research procedure was divided into two parts: data collecting and pre-processing, and building the machine learning algorithm, pre-training and testing.FindingsGender, family income, region and achievement in the national secondary school examination (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia [SPM]) predict academic performance. Female students were 1.2 times more likely to succeed academically. Central region students performed better with a value of 1.26. M40-income students were more likely to excel with an odds ratio of 2.809. Students who excelled in SPM English and Mathematics had a better likelihood of succeeding in higher education.Research limitations/implicationsThis research was limited to pre-diploma students from UiTM Pahang Branch. For better generalizability of the results, future research should include pre-diploma students from other UiTM branches that offer this programme.Practical implicationsThis study is expected to offer insights for policymakers, particularly, the Ministry of Higher Education, in developing a comprehensive policy to improve the tertiary education system by focusing on the fourth Sustainable Development Goal.Social implicationsThese pre-diploma students were found to originate mainly from low- or middle-income families; hence, the programme may help them acquire better jobs and improve their standard of living. Most students enrolling on the pre-diploma performed below excellent at the secondary school level and were therefore given the opportunity to continue studying at a higher level.Originality/valueThis predictive model contributes to guidelines on the minimum requirements for pre-diploma students to gain admission into higher education institutions by ensuring the efficient distribution of resources and equal access to higher education among all communities."
Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Predicting Graduation Timelines in Moroccan Universities;"Sadqui, Azeddine; Ertel, Merouane; Sadiki, Hicham; Amali, Said";2023;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;;;;;Yes;The escalating student numbers in Moroccan universities have intensified the complexities of managing on -time graduation. In this context, Machine learning methodologies were utilized to analyze the patterns and predict on-time graduation rates in a comprehensive manner. Our dataset comprised information from 5236 bachelor students who graduated in the years 2020 and 2021 from the Faculty of Law, Economic, and Social Sciences at Moulay Ismail University. The dataset incorporated a diverse range of student attributes including age, marital status, gender, nationality, socio-economic category of parents, profession, disability status, province of residence, high school diploma attainment, and academic honors, all contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing graduation outcomes. Implementation and evaluation of the performance of five different machine learning models: Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, were carried out. These models were assessed based on their classification Reports, confusion matrices, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. From the findings, the Random Forest model emerged as the most accurate in predicting on-time graduation, showcasing the highest accuracy and ROC AUC score. Despite these promising results, it is believed that performance enhancements can be achieved through further tuning and preprocessing of the dataset. Insights from this study could enable Moroccan universities, among others, to better comprehend the factors influencing on-time graduation and implement appropriate measures to improve academic outcomes.

Summer Research Education Program for Promoting Computational Neuroimaging Technology in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD);;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;AbstractNeuroimaging technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) is critical to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD) studies. In spite of the wide consensus that the integration of neuroimaging and data science approaches offers a powerful tool for understanding the underlying disease mechanisms and developing personalized treatment strategies for AD / ADRD, we are facing the urgent challenge of a capable workforce with computational neuroimaging skill-sets, due to the lack of early exposure to high-quality, hands-on research education experiences in the imaging-based AD / ADRD studies. To address this challenge, we form an inter-disciplinary team of data scientists and AD / ADRD experts to develop a summer research education program on computational neuroimaging for NIA expanding research in AD / ADRD (ERA). Specifically, our education program consists of four inter-connected components. First, we will design a hybrid curriculum of computational neuroimaging for high school students that includes a set of synchronous/ asynchronous short courses covering research ethics, imaging physics, biomedical image processing, statistical inference, machine learning, and AD/ ADRD clinical applications. Second, we will develop a collection of hands-on tutorials to train the students how to formulate the AD / ADRD question into a well-posed computational problem, how to analyze neuroimaging data, and how to translate the computational tools into clinical applications. Third, we will build a cloud-based neuroimage processing platform with the integrative functions of visualization, analysis, and data management/ sharing, which allows us to deliver the computational power to every student in this research education program. Lastly, and primarily, we will manage a project-based mentoring plan to offer each student a one-to-one open research exploration opportunity with AD / ADRD experts in UNC, Duke, and Wake Forest University during the summer program. We will work with the academic mentors to continue the training for motivated high school students by tracking the project progress, providing career advice, and evaluating the training performance. Under the umbrella of AD / ADRD research, we will partner with two NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) at Duke/UNC and Wake Forest University. We will also align our education program with the existing renewed STEM programs at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and North Carolina Science & Engineering Fair to engage high school students with diverse scientific and cultural backgrounds and develop a research outreach plan for including underrepresented groups in the biomedical science to the NIH AD / ADRD portfolio. The success of the program is built upon the unique neuroimaging, data science, and education expertise of the PIs (Drs. Wu and Kaur) and their collaborative relationships with experts in computer science, biostatistics, psychiatry, neurology, and radiology research faculties. The synergistic integration of research, mentoring, and outreach will enthusiastically engage more prospective students in AD / ADRD research, contributing to a collaborative research environment in the nation.

In so doing, it is to suggest ways to foster gifted education of the new era. In addition, by analyzing empirical cases of English-speaking countries that have developed the world's first computer and information science, and continuously developed world-class programming and artificial intelligence technology, this paper analyzes why it is necessary to improve English proficiency to gifted students who will become outstanding programmers of the future. It is analyzed based on the GED official data from KEDI. The 4th Industrial Revolution calls for strong changes in the field of gifted education. Nevertheless, in 2018, only 139 (0.6%) out of the 2,684 institutions are dedicated to the education of informatics gifted children. The other 2,430 (90.5%) institutions are only dedicated to the subjects of mathematics and other scientific subjects. In addition, only a few gifted eduction programs for computer science are led by elementary and secondary schools, and mostly various levels of programming and software classes are conducted by university affiliated institutions. This can be attributed to the fact that the number of gifted education for computer science, which requires a large number of budgets and facilities, programming professionals. And, the influence rate for university admissions are much lower compared to other subjects. In addition, this paper analyzes the fact that the coding education in the elementary and secondary schools from the year of 2018-19 is organized into regular courses to become a crisis and opportunity of the gifted education for computer science. It is based on the contents of the general coding education manual of KERIS. Throughout this paper, by and large this study examines the necessity of improving the proficiency of English in order to overcome such a crises and to expand and develop the gifted education for computer science.
The Comparison of K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) Algorithm and Fuzzy Tsukamoto Logic in the Determination of SMA Students Majors in Banten;"Akhirina, T.

Most of private schools of SMA have not had a system and standardization in the students' majors. Factors of majors 'determination have not been based on students' skill, interest, and aptitude. This present research aims at assessing two approaches in benefiting data of SMA majors. The first approach is by usingK-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, and the second one is by using Fuzzy Tsukamoto method. From the data assessment in SMA students' majors, both of approaches (i.e., K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm and Fuzzy Tsukamoto method) can be used for SMA students' majors with a fairly-high percentage of accuracy, of which K-NN98,4% and Tsukamoto 99,2%.

From those both methods, the comparison is conducted by using three factors, that is, final result, data processing, and the speed of process by looking at the condition in the field, then it is found that Fuzzy Tsukamoto method is better than K-NN method in SMA students' majors in Banten.
A Learning Ecosystem for Teaching High School Students Machine Learning Concepts and Data Science Skills in Healthcare and Medicine;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Healthcare is rapidly changing into a multidisciplinary field. Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) have become integral for healthcare and medical services. Machine Learning (ML), a branch of AI, is broadly applicable for developing predictive models that drive research, development and healthcare practices. Unintentional bias within the datasets and computer programs used for ML creates healthcare outcomes which benefit some people more than others. This project will develop an innovative and inclusive learning and teaching ecosystem for high school students. The ecosystem consists of educational agencies and teachers, cross-disciplinary expertise from data scientists and medical clinicians, community members and college students from diverse background as mentors. Authentic cross-cultural discussions amongst community members and students will be a key component of students??? learning experience. The ecosystem will provide a data science and ML laboratory course and an annual datathon. Computer science teachers will facilitate the course, and will also receive professional development in problem-based data science approaches. Students in the course will explore student-led, inquiry-based strategies on how to navigate and visualize large healthcare sets using the same programming languages and tools that data scientists use. During the datathon, students will team with their local community members and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teachers to solve authentic data-driven healthcare issues which are important and personal to them. Community members will share their experiences to ensure all voices are heard. Datathon participants will be introduced to culturally-responsive methods. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST), which seeks to engage underrepresented students in technology-rich learning environments, including skills in data literacy, and increase students??? knowledge and interest in information and communication technology (ICT) careers. During the project period, researchers will develop and study a semester-long program that engages up to 1000 Rhode Island high school students, with an emphasis on recruiting racial minorities and young women from 12 Title 1 schools. The researchers will investigate how students engage in the program and datathon, the usability and sustainability of this program, and the enactment of the innovative learning ecosystem. The following questions will guide this study: 1) How do the data laboratory and datathon contribute to student learning and efficacy in data science, and their interest in data science and healthcare careers? 2) What are teachers??? perspectives about the usability and effectiveness, including challenges, of the materials, curriculum, and supports? 3) How do teachers take up and enact the activities and tools to support student learning and interests in data science? Researchers will collect and analyze data using mixed methods, including data from a digital learning platform, surveys, interviews, assessments, and observations. The outcome will include a novel pedagogy for teaching high school students about rapidly evolving technologies. Deliverables will consist of annual professional development for the teachers; a public website for all Rhode Island district leaders, teachers, and parents; a vetted data science and ML laboratory course; and designs of the multidisciplinary, cross-cultural datathon. These will be freely shared and promoted online, presented at professional conferences, and published as research articles in peer-reviewed literature. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Deep Learning-Based Correlation Analysis between the Evaluation Score of English Teaching Quality and the Knowledge Points;Li, Yuanyuan;2022;COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.1155/2022/4102959;;;;Yes;As one of the three main courses from primary school to senior high school, improving the quality of English teaching in and out of class has become the top priority of colleges and universities. English knowledge points are complex, and domestic scholars have studied vocabulary knowledge and grammatical awareness from various perspectives, but there is still a lack of research on the correlation between vocabulary knowledge, grammatical awareness, and cloze test scores of senior high school students. Therefore, this paper carries out empirical research from the depth of English vocabulary, English grammar, reading comprehension, cloze test, and composition, aiming at exploring the relationship between teaching quality and English knowledge points. Classroom teaching quality evaluation is the basic content of education quality evaluation, which not only needs to evaluate the effect of class hours but also needs a student's long-term learning effect. In order to improve the quality of classroom English teaching, enrich the content of classroom English, and ultimately make the quality of students' learning to a higher level, the combination model of the teaching quality evaluation index is established by combining the decision tree with the knowledge point rule association method and the evaluation results are verified by association rule analysis. This paper selects the effective indicators that affect the evaluation of English teaching quality, determines the weight of the indicators by using the analytic hierarchy process, effectively constructs the combination model of the decision tree and rule association method, and establishes the evaluation model of students' English learning ability in the classroom. Taking students as the main object and combining them with the requirements of digital teaching, the evaluation index system is formed, the index weight is determined by using the analytic hierarchy process, and the classroom teaching quality evaluation model based on the decision tree and English knowledge point correlation analysis is constructed to truly reflect the teaching level of teachers, and the correlation analysis is carried out between English teachers' own quality and students' learning effects and knowledge points. By testing the model performance of English vocabulary depth, reading comprehension, grammar, writing, and other knowledge points, we can well evaluate and analyze students' mastery of English learning and the correlation of English knowledge points.
Collaborative Research: A Semiconductor Curriculum and Learning Framework for High-Schoolers Using Artificial Intelligence, Game Modules, and Hands-on Experiences;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Semiconductors are essential components of electronic devices, enabling advances in important applications and systems such as communication, healthcare, and national security. In order to sustain the U.S.'s global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry, there is a growing demand for a skilled semiconductor workforce.

Marlo's Networks of Expectations in the Classroom: A Tool for Heterogeneous Reasoning;Lopez Aznar, Marcos Bautista;2020;DIAGRAMMATIC REPRESENTATION AND INFERENCE, DIAGRAMS 2020;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-54249-8_44;;;;Yes;In this article we present some results obtained between 2016 and 2019 using Marlo's expectations networks (M.E.N.) as a tool in the teaching of logic in a secondary school in Huelva, Spain. M.E.N is a Bayesian tree structure implemented with logical nodes in which the propositions can be encoded as true, false, probable or uncertain. These networks have been used with students be-tween the ages of 14 and 18 to solve problems of first-order logic and mathematical probability. The networks, which have been developed in parallel with the Marlo diagram, represent in an exhaustive and heterogeneous manner all combinations of variables that can take place in the universe of discourse. Students make inferences by interpreting, on the one hand, the spatial information offered by the coordinates of the variables within the system, and on the other hand, the labels of natural and formal languages. But in addition, the truth values of each of these nodes can be expressed by perfectly synchronized numerical and chromatic scales. From these heterogeneous forms of graphic representation, we have created digital infographics that can be used on laptops and mobile phones in the classroom. From daily practice with these tools, we verify that some students with mathematical learning disabilities can reason in a surprisingly fluid and rigorous manner using colors. It is also notable that some of the best mathematical students cannot reason using colors. In any case, all students (chromatic, based on numbers and mixed) benefit from the diagrams.
A Development of a Deep Learning Teaching Model based on Tensorflow;"Kang, Hwan-Soo; Cho, Jin-Hyung; Kim, Hee-Chern";2022;Journal of Digital Contents Society;research-article;WoS;10.9728/dcs.2022.23.5.905;;;;Yes;Recently, the importance of artificial intelligence literacy, which requires basic knowledge of artificial intelligence, has been emphasized in school education. In Korean high schools, artificial intelligence mathematics and basics are operated as elective subjects. In this study, a tensorflow-based deep learning teaching model was developed for computer-related students at a two-year college university, and this model was operated in actual classes to verify the effectiveness by a paired t-test. In order to verify the effectiveness of the learning competency of this model, the learning competencies of ‘Utilization Colab and GitHub’, ‘Understanding AI, ML(Machine Learning) and deep learning’ and ‘Implementing deep learning based on Tensorflow’ were derived and analyzed with paired t-test. A significant result was obtained that students' competence in deep learning was improved through pre and post tests applying the study's teaching model.
Examining computational thinking processes in modeling unstructured data;"Jiang, Shiyan; Qian, Yingxiao; Tang, Hengtao; Yalcinkaya, Rabia; Rose, Carolyn P.; Chao, Jie; Finzer, William";2023;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-022-11355-3;;;;Yes;"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly pervasive in our daily lives, the need for students to understand the working mechanisms of AI technologies has become more urgent. Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes."

A Study of Text Difficulty Assessment Based on Decision Trees;"Xiao, Jinxi; Zhu, Jiuyuan; Shen, Qiyou";2022;2022 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA AND INFORMATION ANALYTICS, BIGDIA;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/BIGDIA56350.2022.9874116;;;;Yes;With the increase of information technology, students can receive more and more reading materials for learning, but how to choose from the huge amount of reading materials and find the right one for them efficiently and accurately has become a difficult problem for students. Therefore, quantitative assessment of text difficulty has become an important topic in the field of language research and education.In this paper, we first analyze the difficulty of English text, classify the text difficulty level into six difficulty levels: elementary school, junior high school, high school, university and subject specialization, and initially determine 27 difficulty quantification indexes in four aspects: vocabulary difficulty, sentence difficulty, difficulty of the whole corpus and speech chunks. The pre-processed text data were then quantified using the Range text quantization tool to generate the training dataset. The classification accuracy of the 27 difficulty indicators was then tested separately, and the different indicators were combined, and the classification accuracy of all the combined indicators was obtained using a genetic algorithm, and the ten combinations of indicators with the highest classification accuracy were finally determined. A decision tree based English text difficulty assessment model was built using the RapidMiner model building tool with the training dataset, and the model was analyzed by the validation results with good classification effects.Next, the model is extended to study the Chinese text difficulty assessment model. According to the characteristics of Chinese, we identified 21 indicators to assess the difficulty of Chinese text for comprehensive consideration, such as: the difficulty of Chinese characters, the difficulty of words, the difficulty of sentences, and the readability of the text as a whole. By collecting Chinese text corpus, a decision tree based Chinese text difficulty assessment model was established using the same method. Through model validation, it is shown that the model has good classification effect.
Predicting Math Performance in High School Students using Machine Learning Techniques;Hui, Yuan;2024;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.14569/IJACSA.2024.0150516;;;Yes;Yes;In the field of education, understanding and predicting student performance plays a crucial role in improving the quality of system management decisions. In this study, the power of various machine learning techniques to learn the complicated task of predicting students' performance in math courses using demographic data of 395 students was investigated. Predicting students' performance through demographic information makes it possible to predict their performance before the start of the course. Filtered and wrapper feature selection methods were used to find 10 important features in predicting students' final math grades. Then, all the features of the data set as well as the 10 selected features of each of the feature selection methods were used as input for the regression analysis with the Adaboost model. Finally, the prediction performance of each of these feature sets in predicting students' math grades was evaluated using criteria such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and mean squared error. The best result was obtained from feature selection by the LASSO method. After the LASSO method for feature selection, the Extra Tree and Gradient Boosting Machine methods respectively had the best prediction of the final math grade. The present study showed that the LASSO feature selection technique integrated with regression analysis with the Adaboost model is a suitable data mining framework for predicting students' mathematical performance.

To Advance AI Use in Education, Focus on Understanding Educators;Kizilcec, Rene F.;2024;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION;Editorial Material;WoS;10.1007/s40593-023-00351-4;;;;Yes;A better understanding of educators' perspectives of emerging education technology, specifically tools that incorporate AI, is essential to unlock the full potential benefits of these innovations. While prior research has primarily emphasized technological advancements, it has overlooked the profound influence of social, psychological, and cultural factors in shaping educators' perceptions, trust, and adoption of educational technology. As increasingly powerful AI tools emerge, their design must be rooted in a deep understanding of educators' needs and perspectives. It is only with the acceptance and trust of educators that these innovative solutions can elevate learning outcomes, academic achievements, and educational equity.

It has the potential to help solve problems that so far have no satisfying method solving them, and to provide significant speedup to solutions when compared with their best classical approaches. In turn, quantum computing may allow us to solve problems for inputs that so far are deemed practically intractable. With the computational power of quantum computers and the proliferation of quantum development kits, quantum computing is anticipated to become mainstream, and the demand for a skilled workforce in quantum computing is expected to increase significantly. Therefore, quantum computing education is ramping up. This article describes our experiences in designing and delivering quantum computing workshops for youth (Grades 9-12). We introduce students to the world of quantum computing in innovative ways, such as newly designed unplugged activities for teaching basic quantum computing concepts. We also take a programmatic approach and introduce students to the IBM Quantum Experience using Qiskit and Jupyter noteBooks. Our contributions are as follows. First, we present creative ways to teach quantum computing to youth with little or no experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas; second, we discuss diversity and highlight various pathways into quantum computing from quantum software to quantum hardware; and third, we discuss the design and delivery of online and in-person motivational, introductory, and advanced workshops for youth."
CAREER: Advancing nanostructure & interface science for permanent magnets without rare earth materials;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports theoretical, computational, and educational activities that aim to advance the fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying nanostructure formation in multicomponent permanent magnet alloys during magnetic-field-assisted manufacturing. This knowledge paves the path toward developing a novel permanent magnet composed of earth-abundant elements that can outperform the state-of-the-art permanent magnets at high temperatures. Current high-temperature permanent magnets, used in electric vehicles and wind power production industries, are based on rare earth elements. The U.S. produces a small fraction globally of industrial rare-earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium. Therefore, developing alternatives to their use can reduce U.S. dependence on these materials and have a positive impact on U.S. national economic and energy security. The PI and his team will develop a new computational model by incorporating novel artificial intelligence methods to unravel the mechanisms that can improve the desirable magnetic properties in a class of alloys made of earth-abundant elements such as iron, aluminum, nickel, and cobalt. A proof-of-concept permanent magnet, based on the chemistry and processing routes predicted by computational modeling, will be fabricated and characterized. This award also supports a unique educational activity for Idaho high school and college students to gain hands-on experience on machine learning through a novel educational curriculum and involvement in authentic machine learning projects together. The project will also provide professional training for high school teachers. The education plan of the project addresses both national and regional workforce shortages in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that primarily originate from low entrance and retention rates, particularly for underserved students. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports research and educational activities that aim to develop a fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying nanostructure formation in multicomponent permanent magnets alloys during thermo-magnetic treatment. The PI and his team will develop an atomistically informed phase-field model to unravel the mechanism of nanostructure formation in FeAlNiCo-based alloys during thermo-magnetic treatment with a particular focus on understanding and engineering the Cu-rich and Ni-rich interfacial phases as solutions for FeCo-rich phase isolation and consequently magnetic property improvement. The team will also develop a new mixed-data three-dimensional convolutional neural network framework to construct the process-structure linkages for FeAlNiCo-based alloys. A proof-of-concept permanent magnet, based on the chemistry and processing routes predicted by the neural network, will be fabricated and characterized. The project outcomes can potentially displace rare earth-based permanent magnets in high-temperature applications, such as electric vehicle and wind generator traction motors, with a more widely available alternative. This award also supports a unique educational activity for Idaho high school and college students to gain hands-on experience on machine learning through a novel educational curriculum and involvement in authentic machine learning projects together. The project will also provide professional training for high school teachers. The education plan of the project addresses both national and regional workforce shortages in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics that primarily originate from low entrance and retention rates, particularly for underserved students. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research through the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

School-Based Management Performance Efficiency Modeling and Profiling using Data Envelopment Analysis and K-Means Clustering Algorithm;"Tibay, Jona P.; Ambat, Shaneth C.; Lagman, Ace C.";2019;2019 IEEE 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICCCS 2019);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ccoms.2019.8821732;;;;Yes;Organizations are challenged to achieve effective and competent results, rising to imminent importance of measuring the performance efficiency. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is an approach that measures performance efficiency of organizations. It is a non-parametric method, which uses linear programming to calculate efficiency in a given set of decision-making units (DMUs). It has widespread application in identifying efficiency and discovering benchmark. In the study, it utilized DEA in identifying School-Based Management (SBM) performance efficiency of one (1) division comprising of elementary and secondary schools under Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines. Efficient schools were used as benchmark for improvement of inefficient schools. The schools had also undergone clustering, which is the process of grouping in accordance to similar characteristics. K-Means clustering algorithm was used to group the schools according to their respective profile. K-Means clustering is a simple unsupervised learning algorithm that follows a simple procedure of classifying a given data set into a number of clusters. The study also encompasses the development of an application system that utilizes data from DEA and K-Means clustering algorithm. The application system also provided recommendations to help inefficient schools improve.
A Novel Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Course for Secondary School Students;"Mahon, Joyce; Quille, Keith; Mac Namee, Brian; Becker, Brett A.";2022;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 53RD ACM TECHNICAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION (SIGCSE 2022), VOL 2;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1145/3478432.3499073;;;;Yes;We present an overview of a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence course that is part of a large online course platform for upper second level students. We take a novel approach to teaching fundamental AI concepts that does not require code, and assumes little prior knowledge including only basic mathematics. The design ethos is for students to gain an understanding of how algorithms can learn. Many misconceptions exist about this term with respect to AI and can lead to confusion and more serious misconceptions, particularly for students who engage with AI-enabled tools regularly. This approach aims to provide insights into how AI actually works, to demystify and remove barriers to more advanced learning, and to emphasize the important roles of ethics and bias in AI. We took several steps to engage students, including videos narrated by a final-year second-level student (US 12th grade). We present design and logistics particulars on this course which is currently being taken by similar to 7,000 students in Ireland. We believe this will be of value to other educators and the wider community.

In School of Engineering, students who enter university without basic mathematical knowledge and skills are categorized as mathematically 'at-risk'. The purpose of this study was to predict 'at risk' students by using Support Vector Machine method. Data of Pamukkale University School of Engineering's 434 incoming students of year 2007 were considered in this study. The result shows that students' university entrance examination mathematics, science and Turkish tests scores and students' high school graduation grade point average are important items to predict students' achievement at university calculus I course. SVM is trained with features of 289 students and tested with features of remaining 145 students. 86% of successful students for calculus I course was predicted as true by SVM.
Effect of coding integrated mathematics program on affective mathematics engagement;"Lee, Yujin; Bicer, Ali; Hyun, Park Ji";2024;Research in Mathematical Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;The integration of coding and mathematics education, known as coding-integrated mathematics education, has received much attention due to the strength of Artificial Intelligence-based Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (AI-based STEAM) education in improving students’ affective domain. The present study investigated the effectiveness of coding-integrated mathematics education on students’ development of affective mathematics engagement. Participants in this study were 86 middle and high school students who attended the coding-integrated mathematics program.Surveys of students’ affective mathematics engagement were administered before and after the intervention period. The results showed that students’ affective mathematics engagement was statistically significantly improved through coding-integrated mathematics education. In particular, students exhibited increased positive affective mathematics engagement in terms of mathematical attitude, emotion, and value. These findings indicate the positive influence of coding-integrated mathematics education on students’ learning in mathematics.
A dynamic thompson sampling hyper-heuristic framework for learning activity planning in personalized learning;"Aslan, Ayse; Bakir, Ilke; Vis, Iris F. A.";2020;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.ejor.2020.03.038;;;;Yes;"Personalized learning is emerging in schools as an alternative to one-size-fits-all education. This study introduces and explores a weekly demand-driven flexible learning activity planning problem of own-pace own-method personalized learning. The introduced problem is a computationally intractable optimization problem involving many decision dimensions and also many soft constraints. We propose batch and decomposition methods to generate good-quality initial solutions and a dynamic Thompson sampling based hyper-heuristic framework, as a local search mechanism, which explores the large solution space of this problem in an integrative way. The characteristics of our test instances comply with average secondary schools in the Netherlands and are based on expert opinions and surveys. The experiments, which benchmark the proposed heuristics against Gurobi MIP solver on small instances, illustrate the computational challenge of this problem numerically. According to our experiments, the batch method seems quicker and also can provide better quality solutions for the instances in which resource levels are not scarce, while the decomposition method seems more suitable in resource scarcity situations. The dynamic Thompson sampling based online learning heuristic selection mechanism is shown to provide significant value to the performance of our hyper-heuristic local search. We also provide some practical insights; our experiments numerically demonstrate the alleviating effects of large school sizes on the challenge of satisfying high-spread learning demands.

The Study of Mathematics Learning Using the Adaptive Tutoring Process Model;"Wang, Kyungsu; Heesuk, Song";2008;THE JOURNAL OF KOREAN EDUCATION;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;This study is to investigate the utilization of case-based adaptive tutoring model for the intelligent tutoring system based upon intelligent tutoring systems approach. Freudenthal(1981) emphasized the use of computer tools in Mathematics education, which enables us to develop mathematical thinking skills(Hwang and others, 2008). This study demonstrates that the existence of irrational numbers, which was selected from high school mathematics of the 9th curriculum and is a typical theorem proving problem, can be taught using Martens' model of adaptive tutoring process(2003, 2004), thus succeeding in developing mathematical thinking skills. Recently the mathematical learning software focus on how to design the system's intelligent behavior to learners response based upon artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This case study successfully shows that adaptive tutoring process model helps students to learn mathematical theorem proving in a intelligent and self-regulated way in complex multimedia environment which has a lot of components.
Using Ontology as Scaffolding for Authoring Teaching Materials;"Yang, Jin Tan David; Yu, Pao Ta; Chen, Nian Shing; Tsai, Chun Yen; Lee, Chin Chin; Shih, Timothy K.";2005;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.4018/jdet.2005010105;;;;Yes;This article introduces mathematics ontology as a means of supporting teachers for authoring teaching materials. The purpose of this study is to conduct teachers to author a teaching material by using visualized domain ontology as scaffolding on a Content Repository Management System (CRMS). Although the domain ontology of mathematics at the secondary school level in Taiwan provides structured vocabularies for describing domain content, for those teachers who want to create a knowledge-rich description of domain knowledge, such as required by the semantic Web, using ontology turns out to provide only part of the knowledge required. In the article, we examine problems related to capturing the learning resources or Learning Objects (LOs) on the CRMS. To construct ontology for a subset of mathematics course descriptions, the representation requirements by Resource Description Framework/Resource Description Framework Schema (RDF/RDFS) was implemented. Furthermore, a Visualized Online Authoring Tool (VOAT) is designed for authoring teaching materials on the Web. Finally, discussion and future research are addressed.
TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS USING PATTERN RECOGNITION (AUGMENTED REALITY);"Avila Nunez, M. R.; Crail Corzas, S. C.; Rodriguez Chavez, R.; Salgado Rodriguez, J. F.";2011;INTED2011: 5TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Today in the Coordination of Mathematics, Basic Sciences Division, Faculty of Engineering (FI) at UNAM there is a high failure rate in mathematics from students. This is because the system taught at high schools is usually two-dimensional Cartesian. At the University, in subjects such as Analytic Geometry, Vector and Integral Calculus, students have trouble viewing loci in the space of three dimensions. Currently both fields of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition permits the implementation of augmented reality from objects to be displayed in a classroom or in any other place through the Internet. Mathematics subjects will be enhanced with the use of augmented reality such as static, linear algebra, kinematics and dynamics among others. In general the implementation of augmented reality from an object has the following advantages: to the Institution for having a bank of objects augmented reality. For professors, as they can create their objects in a three-dimensional Cartesian system to be visualized enhancing and supporting their teaching-learning process. Moreover, students will have items for reinforcing the subjects and will also interact with those objects inside and outside the classroom.
Geo-LLaVA: A Large Multi-Modal Model for Solving Geometry Math Problems with Meta In-Context Learning;"Xu, Shihao; Luo, Yiyang; Shi, Wei";2024;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND WORKSHOP ON LARGE GENERATIVE MODELS MEET MULTIMODAL APPLICATIONS, LGM(CUBE)A 2024;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1145/3688866.3689124;;;;Yes;Geometry mathematics problems pose significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) because they involve visual elements and spatial reasoning. Current methods primarily rely on symbolic character awareness to address these problems. Considering geometry problem solving is a relatively nascent field with limited suitable datasets and currently almost no work on solid geometry problem solving, we collect a geometry question-answer dataset by sourcing geometric data from Chinese high school education websites, referred to as GeoMath. It contains solid geometry questions and answers with accurate reasoning steps as compensation for existing plane geometry datasets. Additionally, we propose a Large Multi-modal Model (LMM) framework named Geo-LLaVA, which incorporates retrieval augmentation with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in the training stage, called meta-training, and employs in-context learning (ICL) during inference to improve performance. Our fine-tuned model with ICL attains the state-of-the-art performance of 65.25% and 42.36% on selected questions of the GeoQA dataset and GeoMath dataset respectively with proper inference steps. Notably, our model initially endows the ability to solve solid geometry problems and supports the generation of reasonable solid geometry picture descriptions and problem-solving steps. Our research sets the stage for further exploration of LLMs in multi-modal math problem-solving, particularly in geometry math problems.
Constructing good solutions for the Spanish school timetabling problem;"AlvarezValdes, R; Martin, G; Tamarit, JM";1996;JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY;Article;WoS;10.2307/3010034;;;;Yes;In the school timetabling problem a set of lessons (combinations of classes, teachers, subjects and rooms) has to be scheduled within the school week. Considering classes, teachers and rooms as resources for the lessons, the problem may be viewed as the scheduling of a project subject to resource constraints. We have developed an algorithm with three phases. In Phase I an initial solution is built by using the scheme of parallel heuristic algorithm with priority rules, but imbedding at each period the construction of a maximum cardinality independent set on a resource graph. In Phase II a tabu search procedure starts from the solution of Phase I and obtains a feasible solution to the problem. The solution obtained is improved in Phase m. Several procedures based on the calculation of negative cost cycles and shortest paths in a solution graph are used to get more compact timetables.The algorithms have been imbedded in a package designed to solve the problem for Spanish secondary schools. The computational results show its performance on a set of real problems. Nevertheless, it can be applied to more general problems and results on a set of large random problems are also provided.
Prior knowledge in mathematics and study success in engineering: informational value of learner data collected from a web-based pre-course;"Derr, Katja; Huebl, Reinhold; Ahmed, Mohammed Zaki";2018;EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1080/03043797.2018.1462765;;;;Yes;The article describes the development and evaluation of a web-based pre-course in mathematics, delivered to four cohorts of engineering students at a German university. Based on demographic, personal, and learning-related data relationships between students' preconditions, their learning gains in the pre-course, and study success in the degree programme were analysed. The results support the existing literature in that domain-related prior knowledge and secondary school achievement play a dominant role regarding study success in engineering. The analyses also showed that the influence of cognitive predictors could only be compensated for by a strong learner engagement. At-risk students with high pre-course learning gains showed significantly better first-year performance. The number of self-tests a student attempted was positively related to pre-course learning gains and even to first-year performance, suggesting that this variable is a good indicator of student engagement.
Predicting Student Success in a Scholarship Program A Comparative Study of Classification Learning Models;"Hajar, Majjate; Adil, Jeghal; Ali, Yahyaouy; Khalid, Alaoui Zidani";2022;DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS, ICDTA 2022, VOL 2;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-02447-4_35;;;;Yes;To be eligible in a scholarship program, the majority of Universities and academic organizations require applicant students to hold a high academic performance, that's why students often have to show proof of their achievement and their excellence in multiple school subjects by presenting their school marks. Therefore, the selection of the right admitted student was never an easy task because selecting the wrong student will have a bad impact on the reputation of the institution. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning method to build a predictive model, where we analyze and compare the performance of eight Machine-learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Tree Classification, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boosting, K-Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, and Gaussian Naive Bayes). This comparison will reveal the algorithm giving the best accuracy score on predicting student admission on our dummy model of scholarship program based on their scores and levels in different topics. In a second part, we explore the technique of Feature Importance to reveal and analyze The Most and the least important features that boost the admission chance. The sample consisted of 200 high school students who had been involved in this study by filling up an online questionnaire. These are our powerful tools to gain the suitable educational dataset to build our predictive model, which showed a high performance according to previous studies in predicting students' chance of admission in terms of various performance metrics for binary classification.
Digital Device and Mathematics: Multilevel vs Machine Learning Models for Value-added Ranking in Italy;Papa, Donatella;2022;CSEDU: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATION - VOL 2;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.5220/0011042700003182;;;;Yes;With the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of distance education programs, digital learning is popular and strategic in many learning fields. The deployment of Information and Communications Technology and its impact on both national and international learning programs are becoming increasingly significant. This study seeks to explore in the Italian context both the effectiveness of digital learning in Mathematics Education and which features and how affect value-added at the classroom level. To explore Information and Communications Technology contribution and value-added scoring, the study takes into consideration the analytical power of classical multilevel models concerning the predictive power of different types of machine learning models. The study aims to investigate how Information and Communications Technology, and related concepts, impact theWeighted Likelihood Estimates in Mathematics for students in the lower secondary school, using data from the INVALSI of the school year 2017/2018. The main finding is that Personal Computer ownership at home plays an important role in mathematical learning. Finally, a machine learning model incorporated in the educational domain can be an interesting starting point for developing class-predictive policies.
Students' Opinions On Artificial Intelligence Based Distance Education System (Artimat);"Karal, Hasan; Nabiyev, Vasif; Erumit, Ali Kursat; Arslan, Selahattin; Cebi, Ayca";2014;GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON LINGUISTICS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE TEACHING (LINELT-2013);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.05.374;;;;Yes;In literature review, it is stated that students face a number of difficulties while they learn the concepts and the relationships between them in mathematics education, and that they often have difficulty in mathematics education. Therefore, mathematics educators have a consensus on developing problem-solving skills of students and that it should be the primary objective of the education. For this reason, the aim of this study is to assess the artificial intelligence based distance education system called ARTIMAT, designed to develop mathematical problem solving skills, in terms of the conceptual competence, the ease of use and students' contribution to the problem solving process. For this purpose, the application was tested with 59 students in 10th grade of an Anatolian High School in Trabzon. Firstly, every student was equipped to use the system individually and later, opinions of the students were taken through structured interviews. In the evaluation of the findings by the study, it was generally concluded that the system fulfilled the needs of the students and was successful. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
A Computer-enhanced Package for Learning School Algebra;;2013;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This proposal is to roll out the outcomes of the ESRC/EPSRC-funded MiGen project, in order to enhance the teaching of early algebra in the secondary school, and thus improve mathematics achievement throughout England. Specifically, we propose to assemble and disseminate to a range of audiences, a polished package of computer and text-based materials for students and teachers based on the MiGen project outputs. The overarching aim is to support the learning of early algebra, in ways that are clearly and explicitly aligned to the National Curriculum and to teachers' practice at Key Stage 3. MiGen focused on a widespread difficulty that impedes students' ability to learn mathematics in secondary school: namely that they routinely fail to see the point of algebra, a finding that has been discussed thoroughly in the literature (e.g. Küchemann, 2010; Mason et al., 2009; Nunes & Bryant, 2010). As a result, they cannot use algebra as a tool for thinking mathematically, which in turn obstructs their learning about and engagement with STEM subjects more generally. MiGen addressed these challenges by building a technical environment with pedagogical rationale and support, as well as associated activities, so that 11-14 year-old students could appreciate from the outset that algebra is about building and expressing structure and generality and that symbolic rules are the language of this expression. A unique feature of this environment is that the computer system provides support to the students, derived from AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques, which offer timely and targeted feedback to students on the basis of their actions. The proposed project has two strands. The first strand will assemble in a coherent package, the outputs of the MiGen project to include student activities, teacher guidance, and 'bridging activities' to assist the transition to paper and pencil. The second strand comprises a series of knowledge-exchange activities, targeted at the teacher and teacher education communities, as well as policy and commercial stakeholders."
SBIR Phase II: Artificial Intelligence Tutoring and Assessment for Teacher Development;;2008;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project focuses on bringing the power and benefits of artificial intelligence tutoring technology to the arena of teacher professional development (PD). The proposed innovation is a teacher professional development system built on the principles of artificial intelligence, and delivered via the Internet. Similar to a flight simulator, this technology will offer a realistic but benign opportunity to test and expand a teacher's preparedness through practice with realistic classroom situations. A key objective is the creation of a classroom simulator which incorporates a virtual master teacher, to help teachers deepen their content understanding, learn to respond to student questions more effectively, practice proven pedagogical techniques for improving student understanding and conduct self-monitoring and assessment before getting in front of a live class. An increasing number of schools are forced to rely on new or out-of-field teachers to fill the gap for teaching science and mathematics, often resulting in a substantial decline in quality, depth and individual attention students receive. Because of the well-documented problems of teachers teaching out of their content areas, and low-performing schools having greater percentages of lesser-qualified teachers, states have established stronger criteria for in-service teachers and newly qualifying pre-service teachers. Middle and high school science and mathematics are the areas where most out-of-area teaching is occurring. In the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Report, 'The Condition of Education', a key finding is that high school students in high-poverty, high-minority schools were more often taught science, mathematics and English courses by out-of-field teachers than their peers in low-poverty, low-minority schools. This research is expected to impact these issues and in addition address the goals of the American Competitiveness Initiative and the requirements for highly qualified teachers identified in the 'No Child Left Behind' initiative.
Brilla AI: AI Contestant for the National Science and Maths Quiz;"Boateng, George; Mensah, Jonathan Abrefah; Yeboah, Kevin Takyi; Edor, William; Mensah-Onumah, Andrew Kojo; Ibrahim, Naafi Dasana; Yeboah, Nana Sam";2024;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION: POSTERS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS, WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION TRACKS, PRACTITIONERS, DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM AND BLUE SKY, AIED 2024, PT I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_17;;;;Yes;The African continent lacks enough qualified teachers which hampers the provision of adequate learning support. An AI could potentially augment the efforts of the limited number of teachers, leading to better learning outcomes. Towards that end, this work describes and evaluates the first key output for the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, which proposes a robust, real-world benchmark for such an AI: Build an AI to compete live in Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition. The NSMQ is an annual live science and mathematics competition for senior secondary school students in Ghana in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this work, we built Brilla AI, an AI contestant that we deployed to unofficially compete remotely and live in the Riddles round of the 2023 NSMQ Grand Finale, the first of its kind in the 30-year history of the competition. Brilla AI is currently available as a web app that livestreams the Riddles round of the contest, and runs 4 machine learning systems: (1) speech to text (2) question extraction (3) question answering and (4) text to speech that work together in real-time to quickly and accurately provide an answer, and then say it with a Ghanaian accent. In its debut, our AI answered one of the 4 riddles ahead of the 3 human contesting teams, unofficially placing second (tied). Improvements and extensions of this AI could potentially be deployed to offer science tutoring to students and eventually enable millions across Africa to have one-on-one learning interactions, democratizing science education.
CAREER: Machine-Learning Assisted Process Systems Engineering: Hybrid modeling for process optimization, design and synThesis;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Process Systems Engineering (PSE) has historically been advanced by using physics-based mathematical models and computer algorithms to design, optimize and control complex systems. Recent advances in the broad field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence have led to a series of breakthroughs in the development of Machine Learning (ML) tools that can be used to derive mathematical models from large data sets. However, ML-based models can be limited in their ability to give insight into the physical origins of the system?s behavior and can result in poor predictions outside of the range of the original data set used to create the model. This CAREER project aims to develop hybrid modeling approaches that preserve what we already know about system behavior to make data-driven ML models more reliable leading to more accurate medical diagnoses, smarter autonomous vehicles, and safer chemical plants. Curriculum development activities are proposed aimed at introducing data science concepts into Chemical Engineering courses and high school statistics classes. Proposed outreach activities are aimed at increasing the number of female engineers in the field of PSE. The proposed methodology aims at developing algorithms that will enable the simultaneous training of modern ML models (i.e., Neural Networks and Gaussian Process Models) with physical constraints that are derived from discretization of first-principles based models. The proposed research will involve a systematic study of pre-processing and integration of data, identification of low-dimensional descriptive feature spaces, hybridization of ML models with first-principles based models and quantification of the uncertainty of hybrid model predictions. The specific research aims are: (1) Theoretically advancing mathematical techniques for training nonparametric ML models to satisfy first-principles based model predictions (hybrid modeling); (2) Quantification of the uncertainty of hybrid models in the presence of noisy and incomplete data sets; (3) Algorithmic development for mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems for design and synThesis with embedded hybrid models. A series of case studies that include production of pharmaceuticals, polymers and chemicals will be used to develop a benchmarking library for testing various hybrid modeling architectures. The design and optimization of bioprocesses will be studied using hybrid modeling to connect gene-level control to macroscale process optimization. A set of hybrid modeling and optimization teaching modules, suitable for incorporation within existing core courses of the Chemical Engineering curriculum, will be developed and broadly disseminated. Outreach activities are proposed that are aimed at introducing data-driven decision-making to high-school students through statistics classes and increasing gender diversity in the field of PSE. A high-school teacher will be hosted by the Principal Investigator in collaboration with the Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC)at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Intern Fellowships for Teachers (GIFT) program, which provides paid summer STEM internships in industry workplaces and University laboratories for K-12 science, mathematics, and technology teachers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Inviting Teachers to Use Educational Robotics to Foster Mathematical Problem-Solving;Estivill-Castro, Vladimir;2020;ROBOTICS IN EDUCATION: CURRENT RESEARCH AND INNOVATIONS;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-26945-6_22;;;;Yes;We have developed three lessons supported by the principles of inquiry-based learning (IBL) and problem-based learning (PBL) in educational robotics with the aim of steering and emphasising the mathematics aspects of the curriculum and the role of mathematics in STEM, while also touching on the social context and impact of STEM. Our goal is to inspire and prompt the curiosity in the participants to seek further understanding in mathematics, to develop mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills, and to see applicability in the emerging world where artificial intelligence and automation are transforming the skills learners will use as professionals. Moreover, we have delivered our ideas to educators in high-school who indicated they would incorporate our challenges and tools to cross-pollinate different areas of STEM.
Using Compiler Errors Messages to Feedback High School Students Through Machine Learning Methods;"Rivero Martinez, Victor Gonzalo; Quintana Lopez, Maricela; Lopez Chau, Asdrubal; Landassuri Moreno, Victor Manuel";2024;ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, MICAI 2023, PT I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-47765-2_22;;;;Yes;Teaching programming is essential for science and technology development in any country. Studies indicate high failure rates in programming subjects, which often lead to frustration or discouragement among students when they encounter coding and compiler error message. This is due to the language and interpretation of such error messages. Several efforts have been made to improve this situation, using neural networks or machine learning techniques to either fix the compiler error or give a more understandable error message. In this work, error-based learning is considered, and instead of fixing errors in the code, compiler error messages are used to provide feedback on syntax errors to programming students. The feedback consists of four components: a translation of the message to Spanish, syntax information about the language item, the error's relation to possible causes and a reference to relevant topics for review. All the given information is intended to help students understand the error, allowing them to rewrite the code and compile it successfully. To achieve that goal, supervised learning was used to build a classifier using the compiler error messages. A set of documents was generated by injecting errors into model programs, thereafter, labelled according to the type of syntax error. The Machine Learning algorithms used were Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbors. These classifiers were trained using 80% of the documents and evaluated with the remaining 20%, achieving an accuracy of over 90% for making new predictions and providing feedback.
STEM education supported by virtual laboratory incorporated in self-directed learning process;"Truchly, Peter; Medvecky, Martin; Podhradsky, Pavol; El Mawas, Nour";2019;JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-ELEKTROTECHNICKY CASOPIS;Article;WoS;10.2478/jee-2019-0065;;;;Yes;Students education in various fields (such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) is constantly looking for ways and techniques on how to motivate students to learn, how to increase their engagement and how to increase the efficiency of knowledge acquisition. Information and communication technologies are developing at a very rapid speed and offer many new opportunities that could be used for such purposes. This paper focuses on virtual laboratory technologies that could be very helpful for these learning problems especially for subjects that lose the interest of young people. We have conducted two pilots at a Slovak secondary school and university to analyse the usability of self-directed learning applied to teach networking topics such as software-defined networking and network functions virtualisation. This learning approach was enhanced by a developed virtual lab and a set of self-tests. Knowledge tests and questionnaires have been used to investigate the impact of this self-directed virtual lab-based learning approach on students motivation to learn, feelings, satisfaction with learning approach and knowledge gain. The results showed that students appreciated the virtual laboratory for improving learning and their motivation to learn and their knowledge acquisition was noticeably improved when the virtual lab was included.
ChatGPT-Based Simulation Helps to Develop the Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers' Critical Thinking;"Drushlyak, Marina; Lukashova, Tetiana; Shamonia, Volodymyr; Semenikhina, Olena";2025;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION;Article;WoS;10.29333/iji.2025.1819a;;;;Yes;"The development of IT affects society in general and the education sector in particular. The emergence of AI (in particular ChatGPT), which is constantly being improved, already causes specific problems in the organization and administration of the educational process. Still, the peculiarities of its functioning make it possible to perceive ChatGPT as learning means in the pre-service mathematics teachers' training. The article presents the results of a study that answers the following questions: (1) Can ChatGPT be a digital platform that generates pupils' answers (secondary school)?- Yes; (2) Are students (pre- service mathematics teachers) prepared to check answers that ChatGPT generates?- Yes; (3) Does checking answers that ChatGPT generates affect the development of students' critical thinking?- Yes. The study involved a pedagogical experiment in which authors described how ChatGPT generates solutions to math problems and what mistakes it makes. We ensured that students sometimes find mathematical mistakes in the answers generated by ChatGPT, but repeated use of ChatGPT shows its positive impact on the development of pre- service mathematics teachers' critical thinking."
Improving Academic Advising in Engineering Education with Machine Learning Using a Real-World Dataset;"Maphosa, Mfowabo; Doorsamy, Wesley; Paul, Babu";2024;ALGORITHMS;Article;WoS;10.3390/a17020085;;;Yes;Yes;The role of academic advising has been conducted by faculty-student advisors, who often have many students to advise quickly, making the process ineffective. The selection of the incorrect qualification increases the risk of dropping out, changing qualifications, or not finishing the qualification enrolled in the minimum time. This study harnesses a real-world dataset comprising student records across four engineering disciplines from the 2016 and 2017 academic years at a public South African university. The study examines the relative importance of features in models for predicting student performance and determining whether students are better suited for extended or mainstream programmes. The study employs a three-step methodology, encompassing data pre-processing, feature importance selection, and model training with evaluation, to predict student performance by addressing issues such as dataset imbalance, biases, and ethical considerations. By relying exclusively on high school performance data, predictions are based solely on students' abilities, fostering fairness and minimising biases in predictive tasks. The results show that removing demographic features like ethnicity or nationality reduces bias. The study's findings also highlight the significance of the following features: mathematics, physical sciences, and admission point scores when predicting student performance. The models are evaluated, demonstrating their ability to provide accurate predictions. The study's results highlight varying performance among models and their key contributions, underscoring the potential to transform academic advising and enhance student decision-making. These models can be incorporated into the academic advising recommender system, thereby improving the quality of academic guidance.
Preparing High School Students for Careers in Machine Learning through Mentored Scientific Research;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming ubiquitous in STEM and across industries, and the education field is grappling with how best to teach AI concepts to K12 audiences. Simultaneously, the AI professional community suffers from a lack of diversity that excludes women and people of color from a dynamic section of the economy and a path for upward mobility. Equally important, a lack of diverse perspectives can risk automating discriminatory practices based on biased algorithms and biased data sets. For over a decade, the Science Research Mentoring Program, a STEM workforce development initiative of the American Museum of Natural History, has provided New York City high school students from underserved populations with the experience of working closely with scientists, increasing access to science fields and careers through research opportunities and mentorship. In this project, the Museum, in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will undertake a three-year research project to innovate within this well-established program by creating opportunities for high school students to learn and apply machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, to scientific problems in the natural sciences. The project responds to the imperative to prepare a diverse student body for a workplace that will require a sophisticated understanding of AI and ML by advancing students' skills and knowledge of ML, promoting awareness of AI and computationally-demanding STEM careers, and fostering positive dispositions towards these fields. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Through this project, 120 students will participate in a four-week Summer Institute specifically focused on developing skills and understanding of ML applications and careers, and 30 of these students will subsequently work in research labs over the academic year with scientists who use ML. A design-based research approach will be used to develop and refine the Summer Institute informed by a team consisting of science educators, scientists, AI experts, and program alumni. Student participants will be recruited specifically from partner organizations that primarily serve Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and first-generation college-bound students. A mixed-method research study will gather data on students' acquisition of ML knowledge and skills, attitudes toward and perceptions of AI, and AI career awareness and interest using pre-post survey instruments, artifact review, semi-structured observations, and interviews. Research findings will be disseminated through conferences, articles, and social media. The curriculum and research tools will be publicly available and readily scalable, leveraging the New York City Science Research Mentoring Consortium, a network of 24 research and cultural institutions serving 500 students annually. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

CAREER: Virtual Reality Simulations of Moral Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Accidents with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) attest to the need to consider the ethical issues inherent in AVs use, and the ethical goal functions they will be programmed to follow. Work with AVs has been dominated by utilitarian models both in algorithms and framing public surveys regarding AVs. However, due to methodological issues and a pronounced resistance of the general public towards utilitarian thinking, there is a need to offer alternative approaches that adequately capture the flexibility of human moral judgment and decision making. This project utilizes the Agent-Deed-Consequence (ADC) model and research on human moral decision making to revolutionize the development of ethical artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the use of virtual reality (VR) and simulations. The project aims to improve high-school and college education, interdisciplinary scientific research, and transportation engineering by partnering with the NC State University Libraries??? Virtual Reality Lab, NC State???s Institute for Transportation Research and Education (ITRE), Professional Engineers of North Carolina (PENC), and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). It contributes to (i) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; (ii) increased participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in research; (iii) improved Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and educator development; and (iv) improved well-being of individuals in society. The ADC model draws on insights from ethics, experimental philosophy, social psychology and decision neuroscience to explain moral judgments and decisions by breaking them down into positive or negative intuitive evaluations concerning the Agent, the Deed, and the Consequence, and designating them as ???high-??? or ???low-stakes??? in any given situation. These intuitive evaluations combine to produce a positive or negative judgment of moral acceptability. For example, the overall moral judgment in a situation in which someone committed a deed that is judged as negative (e.g., changing lanes on a full line) would be mitigated if the agent had good intentions (e.g., circumventing a hazard) and the consequences were good (e.g., an accident was avoided). The ADC model provides formulas for representing such situations (e.g., [A+], [D-] & [C+] = [MJ+] or positive moral judgment). This project develops new moral situations about potentially harmful decisions involving traffic, including vehicles and pedestrians, and tests moral judgment on samples of high-school students, professional moral philosophers, and lay people with no formal training in ethics. The moral situations are programmed and recorded as animations in an immersive VR setting, and tested in populations of high school and college students as well as ethicists. The project culminates with a prototype ethical algorithm based on the ADC model which interacts with human decision makers in a simulated visual environment in the high-fidelity traffic simulator.

Predicting student self-efficacy in Muslim societies using machine learning algorithms;"Ba-Aoum, Mohammed; Alrezq, Mohammed; Datta, Jyotishka; Triantis, Konstantinos P.";2024;FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA;Article;WoS;10.3389/fdata.2024.1449572;;;;Yes;Introduction Self-efficacy is a critical determinant of students' academic success and overall life outcomes. Despite its recognized importance, research on predictors of self-efficacy using machine learning models remains limited, particularly within Muslim societies. This study addresses this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze key factors influencing students' self-efficacy.Methods An empirical dataset collected was used to examine self-efficacy among secondary school students in Muslim societies. Four machine learning algorithms-Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network-were employed to predict self-efficacy using two demographic variables and 10 socio-emotional, cognitive, and regulatory factors. The predictors included culturally relevant variables such as religious/spiritual beliefs and collectivist-individualist orientation. Model performance was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE) and r-squared (R2) metrics to ensure reliability and validity.Results The results showed that Random Forest outperformed the other models in accuracy, as measured by R2 and RMSE metrics. Among the predictors, self-regulation, problem-solving, and a sense of belonging emerged as the most significant factors, contributing to more than half of the model's predictive power. Other variables such as gratitude, forgiveness, empathy, and meaning-making displayed moderate predictive value, while gender, emotion regulation, and collectivist-individualist orientation had minimal impact. Notably, religious/spiritual beliefs and regional factors showed negligible influence on self-efficacy predictions.Discussion This study enhances the understanding of factors influencing self-efficacy among students in Muslim societies and offers a data-driven foundation for developing targeted educational interventions. The findings highlight the utility of machine learning in education research, demonstrating its ability to uncover insights for equitable and effective decision-making. By emphasizing the importance of regulatory and socio-emotional factors, this research provides actionable insights to elevate student performance and well-being in diverse cultural contexts.

A Research of Activity Related to Convergence Teaching and Learning Methods Using Artificial Intelligence in Advanced Mathematics Courses for Gifted Students;Mun,, Saehyeon;2024;Convergence Education Review;research-article;WoS;10.69742/cer.2024.10.1.23;;;;Yes;This study studied convergence teaching and learning activities using artificial intelligence in an advanced mathematics course for gifted students. The goal is to present a vision for developing a convergent advanced mathematics learning environment for gifted students who will lead the cutting-edge artificial intelligence academia. To this end, in this study, the linear system of advanced mathematics courses related to artificial intelligence technology was used as an educational material, and a scenario involving teaching and learning activities, in which convergence activities were carried out, was developed. In addition, in order to improve the educational environment for gifted students in the future, a high school classroom environment was assumed and presented using artificial intelligence technology that is not currently applied in the educational environment. To enhance the potential for practical application, the opinions of mathematics and informatics teachers employed at actual gifted schools were collected twice during the development process. Their feedback was incorporated to finalize the scenario. This study is expected to be helpful in developing systems and programs suitable for the teaching and learning process of gifted school students. By presenting the scenario development process, this study may also have implications for researchers who wish to develop related scenarios in the future.

Realistic Matematic Approach through Numbered Head Together Learning Model;"Sugihatno, A. C. M. S.; Budiyono; Slamet, I.";2017;INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION (ICMSCE);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1088/1742-6596/895/1/012026;;;;Yes;Recently, the teaching process which is conducted based on teacher center affect the students interaction in the class. It causes students become less interest to participate. That is why teachers should be more creative in designing learning using other types of cooperative learning model. Therefore, this research is aimed to implement NHT with RMA in the teaching process. We utilize NHT since it is a variant of group discussion whose aim is giving a chance to the students to share their ideas related to the teacher's question. By using NHT in the class, a teacher can give a better understanding about the material which is given with the help of Realistic Mathematics Approach (RMA) which known for its real problem contex. Meanwhile, the researcher assumes instead of selecting teaching model, Adversity Quotient (AQ) of student also influences students' achievement. This research used the quasi experimental research. The samples is 60 students in junior high school, it was taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique. The results show NHT-RMA gives a better learning achievement of mathematics than direct teaching model and NHT-RMA teaching model with categorized as high AQ show different learning achievement from the students with categorized as moderate and low AQ.
A machine learning approach to investigating the effects of mathematics dispositions on mathematical literacy;"Gabriel, Florence; Signolet, Jason; Westwell, Martin";2018;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH & METHOD IN EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1080/1743727X.2017.1301916;;;;Yes;Mathematics competency is fast becoming an essential requirement in ever greater parts of day-to-day work and life. Thus, creating strategies for improving mathematics learning in students is a major goal of education research. However, doing so requires an ability to look at many aspects of mathematics learning, such as demographics and psychological dispositions, in an integrated way as part of the same system. Large-scale assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) provide an accessible and large volume of coherent data, and this gives researchers the opportunity to employ data-driven approaches to gain an overview of the system. For these reasons, we have used machine learning to explore the relationships between psychological dispositions and mathematical literacy in Australian 15-year-olds using the PISA 2012 data set. Our results from this strongly data-driven approach re-affirm the primacy of mathematics self-efficacy and highlight novel complex interactions between mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and socio-economic status. In this paper, we demonstrate how education researchers can usefully employ data-driven modelling techniques to find complex non-linear relationships and novel interactions in a multidimensional data set.
Conceptual Framework on League Learning Management;"Chutipascharoen, Anutchai; Krootjohn, Soradech";2020;IMPACT OF THE 4TH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION ON ENGINEERING EDUCATION, ICL2019, VOL 1, VOL. 1134;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-40274-7_47;;;;Yes;This article proposes a novel learning model called League Learning based on a combination of cooperative learning methods and various competition principles including TGT, STAD, Gamification, and League Competition in sports such as British Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, etc. League Learning is designed to meet the needs of students in this generation. It employs Round-Robin format for scheduling competitions at weekly basis. The learning process consists of 5 stages, including Coaching, Training, Competing, Declaring, and Pairing. League Learning is suitable for classrooms of Middle School and High School students on the subjects concerning Mathematics, Computations, Analytical Thinking, Logical Thinking, and other related subjects. It raises student's awareness to always be ready for the upcoming competition, while simultaneously promotes cooperation and collaboration with other students. With all the aforementioned, League Learning should be able to make students become more proactive and yield better learning performance resulting in higher learning achievement. Finally, with the support from today internet technologies, League Learning can be implemented online. This can publicly extend knowledge sharing among students worldwide and possibly result in reducing inequity in global learning societies as well.
A Theoretical Framework for a Mathematical Cognitive Model for Adaptive Learning Systems;"Sun, Siyu; Wu, Xiaopeng; Xu, Tianshu";2023;BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/bs13050406;;;;Yes;The emergence of artificial intelligence has made adaptive learning possible, but building an adaptive system requires a comprehensive understanding of students' cognition. The cognitive model provides a crucial theoretical framework to explore students' cognitive attributes, making it vital for learning assessment and adaptive learning. This study investigates 52 experts, including primary and secondary school teachers, mathematics education experts, and graduate students, based on the 16 cognitive attributes in the TIMSS 2015 assessment framework. Through an analysis of their attribute questionnaires, the Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method is used to construct a five-level mathematical cognitive model. The model is then revised through oral Reports and expert interviews, resulting in a final cognitive model ranging from memorize to justify. The cognitive model describes the relationship between different attributes in detail, enabling the development of adaptive systems and aiding in the diagnosis of students' cognitive development and learning paths in mathematics.
Using machine learning to predict factors affecting academic performance: the case of college students on academic probation;"Al-Alawi, Lamees; Al Shaqsi, Jamil; Tarhini, Ali; Al-Busaidi, Adil S.";2023;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-023-11700-0;;;;Yes;This study aims to employ the supervised machine learning algorithms to examine factors that negatively impacted academic performance among college students on probation (underperforming students). We used the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) methodology on a sample of N = 6514 college students spanning 11 years (from 2009 to 2019) provided by a major public university in Oman. We used the Information Gain (InfoGain) algorithm to select the most effective features and ensemble methods to compare the accuracy with more robust algorithms, including Logit Boost, Vote, and Bagging. The algorithms were evaluated based on the performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and ROC curve, and then validated using 10-folds cross-validation. The study revealed that the main identified factors affecting student academic achievement include study duration in the university and previous performance in secondary school. Based on the experimental results, these features were consistently ranked as the top factors that negatively impacted academic performance. The study also indicated that gender, estimated graduation year, cohort, and academic specialization significantly contributed to whether a student was under probation. Domain experts and other students were involved in verifying some of the results. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.
CAREER: First-principles Predictive Understanding of Chemical Order in Complex Concentrated Alloys: Structures, Dynamics, and Defect Characteristics;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and educational activities to develop quantum mechanical and machine learning methods to understand and design complex multi-element alloys at the atomic level. The project focuses on complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), a class of novel alloys that mix atoms of different species at nearly equal ratios. The scientific drive for studying CCAs is to understand and utilize the vast chemical and structural design space associated with multiple elements in search of new materials properties. Current understanding about the stability, structures, and properties of alloys is limited to the corners and edges of the multi-element space, such as binary or dilute alloys. The information for CCAs close to the center of the composition space is virtually non-existent for systems with four or more elements. The project intends to fill this knowledge gap in alloy theory for these complex alloy systems by (i) establishing an accurate predictive understanding of the atomic structures in CCAs through a combination of quantum mechanical calculations and statistical mechanics methods, and (ii) integrating quantum mechanical calculations, empirical models and close-loop machine learning methods to predict the structural and defect features in CCAs for accelerated design of CCAs for structural or functional applications. The multidisciplinary nature of the project brings perspectives from multiple academic fields into the forefront of materials research. The focus of the technologically relevant CCAs will strengthen the U.S. leadership in fundamental alloy research. The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development. The project brings together national and local partners to create a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise to strengthen Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education and raise the awareness of materials science. In collaboration with Amazon, a cloud-based learning app will be developed to transplant the PI?s research and introduce materials and data science to the general public. The PI will collaborate with SMASH Illinois to offer academic and social programs to underrepresented students to broaden participation in materials education. In parallel, summer camps with North Central College and Questek, as well as high school research programs with Adlai E. Stevenson High School will be expanded to expose the younger generation to materials science. The PI will also work closely with undergraduate and graduate students to foster multidisciplinary career development via project-based research programs. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and educational activities to develop first-principles and data-driven methods to understand the atomic nature of short range order (SRO) in complex concentrated alloys (CCAs) and how such chemical order influences lattice distortion, dynamics, and defect structures, thus creating opportunities for designing new advanced alloys. Severe lattice distortion is an important phenomenon that is correlated to a variety of physical and chemical properties in CCAs. However, the nature of severe lattice distortions in CCAs is poorly understood, especially with the coupling of SRO. The PI will study SRO and related lattice distortions in CCAs with a unique synergy of mechanism investigation, predictive modeling, and methodology development. The research will elucidate SRO on the structures of lattice distortions in CCAs, which will be utilized to quantify the impact of the distorted lattices on the phonon characteristics of CCAs. Results and methodology from bulk CCAs will be applied to establish a predictive mapping linking defect characteristics with local environments in CCAs, providing the foundation for computational design of CCAs for superior mechanical properties. The project will be driven by the parallel research on a hierarchical data-driven computational framework that enables efficient predictions of structure-property relationships for CCAs. The education and outreach activities of the project includes five integrated parts that address learning tool innovation, broadening participation, youth material education, summer research exposure, and research career development. The project brings together national and local partners to create a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise to strengthen Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education and raise the awareness of materials science.

Developing the prediction model of at-risk freshmen students and analyzing characteristics of cluster based on learning analytics;"Ho, Shin Jong; choi, jaewon";2019;Journal of Educational Technology;research-article;WoS;10.17232/KSET.35.2.425;;;;Yes;It is highly important to make proactive interventions for students at-risk through early prediction by considering how the first semester GPA would effect the student’s overall academic success to higher education. In this research, we have collected, analyzed a data set of 4,662 freshmen students in “A” university from 2016 to 2018, and developed a machine learning prediction model to find students who are more likely to get bad grades at the end of first semester. Finally, we also drew implications to design intervention programs by analyzing characteristics of at-risk students. The performance of the prediction model using XGboost had a recall (62.3%), precision (29.56%), F-score (0.4), and AUC (0.733). This performance of the model can be acceptable in a situation where data on freshmen is insufficient. The most important predictor variables in this model were self-regulatory capabilities, the high-school GPA in social sciences, Korean language & mathematics scores in College Scholastic Ability Test, etc. Students at risk are clustered into six groups by K-means clustering analysis according to their level of satisfaction in college and self-regulated learning. From the research results, we suggested what should be considered to take intervention for practice in higher education and how to collect and analyze data to improve model performance for future work in this area of research.
Project Engage: Training Secondary Teachers to Deliver Computer Science and Engineering Instruction;;2014;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Developing computer science teachers who can support high school students in being successful in rigorous, academic computer science courses is a national need. Project Engage: Training Secondary Teachers to Deliver Computer Science and Engineering Instruction will support the implementation of an emerging Computer Science Principles course called Thriving in Our Digital World (TODW) in forty-five urban, suburban, and rural schools, including public, private, magnet, and charter schools, in Texas. The TODW course will be offered in a unique dual enrollment mode (concurrent high school and college credit). This project will test two innovative professional development techniques for expanding the reach to more schools: flipped classroom techniques, in which teachers receive recorded video-based professional development, and then use face-to-face time for more hands-on activities; and an automated system which will use artificial intelligence technology to support negotiation of common grades for student work between high school teachers and college faculty. This project's research agenda will address the following core challenge: In a field such as computer science where there is limited expertise, how can we most efficiently scale professional development so as many schoolteachers as possible can provide high quality instruction? The STEM-C (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, including Computing) Partnerships program supports research-driven partnerships between STEM experts and K-12 school systems to bring about institutional change for better STEM education at the K-12 level. This STEM-C Partnerships' Computer Science Education Expansion project builds on prior funding of the UTeachEngineering: Training Secondary Teachers to Deliver Design-Based Engineering Instruction Partnerships through the National Science Foundation's Math and Science Partnership program. This project will produce the scientific foundation and the concrete artifacts needed to deliver a highly scalable curriculum for TODW. The artifacts will include a differentiated curriculum, scalable professional development, and scalable assessment tools and processes. The differentiated curriculum will include formative assessments which can be used by teachers to architect novel pathways through the curriculum for individual students or whole classes. Assessments will be created that can be delivered through a double-blind collaborative review (DBCR) rubric scoring tool, which will include machine learning algorithms that help detect consistent discrepancies between scores of individual (novice) computer science teachers and (expert) college-level computer science professors. The DBCR tool will use machine learning techniques such as basic text features (Bag of Words), syntactic and semantic modeling (n-grams and Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and cluster analysis against existing artifact corpora. Since the assessments of student artifacts are explicitly tied to rubrics, human evaluators may also use the DBCR tool to specify specific features that support line item rubric scores. The available features will vary from project to project but will leverage a variety of tools available in the DBCR user interface: (1) selectable categorical classifications, (2) the highlighting of relevant text features, and (3) annotations to mark document structures, such as cross references and supporting evidence. Project evaluation will focus on both implementation fidelity of the TODW course and student-level outcomes in classes that implement TODW. If successful, the professional development could serve as a model for more scalable teacher professional development in many domains."
Narrative Modeling with StoryQ: Integrating Mathematics, Language Arts, and Computing to Create Pathways to Artificial Intelligence Careers;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The future workforce is being drastically reshaped by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The advancement in AI theories, algorithms and practices has not only created great demands for AI scientists, engineers, technicians and entrepreneurs, but also reformulated the nature of work in almost all industries. Importantly today's students must gain a fundamental understanding of AI in order to be prepared to enter the workforce of the future. This project will design a 12-lesson high school curriculum called StoryQ and associated teaching guides that will provide students with firsthand experience on how narrative modeling, one of the oldest fields in artificial intelligence, can be developed while working on their language arts writing projects. By integrating age-appropriate mathematics, language arts, and computing concepts, researchers will leverage advanced data exploration and text mining technologies, and employ research-based pedagogical approaches to help high school students learn basic concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Led by a multidisciplinary team of learning technology and data experts, machine learning researchers, and experts in the integration of narrative modeling and mathematics learning, the project will focus on helping students envision their future careers as powered by artificial intelligence. The researchers will create and test StoryQ, a web-based text mining and narrative modeling platform, and develop, implement, and test narrative modeling with StoryQ curriculum. Students will learn to design, build, test, and iteratively improve machine learning models of narratives sourced both from student and teacher selected literature and from students? own writings. Beginning with core narrative concepts, students will engage in development cycles that lead them to explore their own writing, annotate models by hand, observe a trained text mining model at work, become familiar with error analysis, and ultimately build their own AI model and evaluation process. The project broadens participation among youth from underrepresented and underserved populations by recruiting participants from two Massachusetts school districts with ethnically and economically diverse populations. To create broadly inclusive learning experiences, students from diverse backgrounds will write narratives to express their cultures and personalities as part of the learning activities. Research questions include (1) How can learning environments be designed to help students understand core AI concepts including the structures in unstructured data and the roles of human insight in the development of AI technologies? and (2) How can learning environments be designed to help students develop awareness and interest in careers that are centered on text mining practices or broadly powered by AI technologies? The project will use a design-based research design. The research team will carry out class observations and in-depth analysis of observational data, and draw design principles for building learning environments that cultivate future STEM and ICT workforce. The project?s success will be evaluated by a group of external evaluators who are experts in diversity and inclusion in AI, computing education, mathematics education, and language arts and literacy education. The outcomes of the project include the resulting web-delivered classroom-ready AI curriculum modules, a teaching guide and teacher resources for high schools, which will be disseminated to teachers and professional development groups.

AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED DISTANCE EDUCATION SYSTEM: Artimat;"Nabiyev, Vasif; Karal, Hasan; Arslan, Selahattin; Erumit, Ali Kursat; Cebi, Ayca";2013;TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION;Article;WoS;;;;;Yes;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the artificial intelligence-based distance education system called as ARTIMAT, which has been prepared in order to improve mathematical problem solving skills of the students, in terms of conceptual proficiency and ease of use with the opinions of teachers and students.The implementation has been performed with 4 teachers and 59 students in 10th grade in an Anatolian High School in Trabzon. Many institutions and organizations in the world approach seriously to distance education besides traditional education. It is inevitable to use the distance education in teaching the problem solving skills in this different dimension of the education. In the studies in Turkey and abroad in the field of mathematics teaching, problem solving skills are generally stated not to be at the desired level and often expressed to have difficulty in teaching.For this reason, difficulties of the students in problem solving have initially been evaluated and the system has been prepared utilizing artificial intelligence algorithms according to the obtained results. In the evaluation of the findings obtained from the application, it has been concluded that the system is responsive to the needs of the students and is successful in general, but that conceptual changes should be made in order that students adapt to the system quickly.

Collaborative Research: Cultivating Tomorrow's Innovators Through Exploring Planetary Images with Artificial Intelligence;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The rapid permeation of AI into nearly all walks of life and every profession calls for innovative approaches of public AI literacy and education in all settings. This project will design, develop, and test a sequence of lessons for high school aged youth from east Tennessee that will teach them artificial intelligence concepts by using images from planetary exploration and emerging Generative AI tools to create visually appealing generative artworks and digital stories. AI concepts grounded in topics that are relevant and engaging through the lens of creative works can serve as an invitation for underrepresented and under-resourced youths to explore fields that they would not otherwise choose or have the opportunity to learn about. The project team including AI researchers and educators, STEM disciplinary experts and the broader creative works community will employ a mixture of out-of-school and online activities, integrating Planetary Science, planetary exploration, big data, creative works, and Generative AI. The works created by youths with the assistance of Generative AI and validated by scientists on planetary exploration and Planetary Science will be showcased online, at the American Museum of Science and Energy, and other public places. This Integrating Research & Practice project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which supports projects that: (a) contribute to research and practice that considers informal STEM learning's role in equity and belonging in STEM; (b) promote personal and educational success in STEM; (c) advance public engagement in scientific discovery; (d) foster interest in STEM careers; (e) create and enhance the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; (f) improve community vibrancy; and/or (g) enhance science communication and the public's engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes, and co-funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Over the three-year project duration, the project will directly impact approximately 360 high school youth and will reach out to a much larger number of participants through online webinars, workshops, newsletters, and exhibits. The project will investigate four research questions: (1) How does participation in an interdisciplinary out-of-school STEM program influence high school youths' AI knowledge and skills, STEM engagement and identity, and sense of belonging to a scientific community? (2) What do youths learn about the value of their personal and cultural knowledge and skills (i.e., assets) to the local and broader community? (3) What program challenges, features, and content appear to have the greatest influence on engagement, identity, and belonging? (4) How do outcomes vary by youth demographics including gender, ethnicity, and urban/rural environment? The research will use a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative surveys with qualitative written reflections and pictures with commentary. In the final year of the project, professional development workshops will train educators to use learning materials generated from the project. Research findings produced through this work will contribute new knowledge on methods and learning designs in integrating AI, STEM and art for informal STEM education.

Cultural integration in AI-enhanced mathematics education: insights from Southeast Asian educators;"Payadnya, I. Putu Ade Andre; Putri, Gusti Ayu Made Arna; Suwija, I. Ketut; Saelee, Sompob; Jayantika, I. Gusti Agung Ngurah Trisna";2025;JOURNAL FOR MULTICULTURAL EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1108/JME-09-2024-0119;Yes;;Yes;Yes;PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in education, yet its cultural impact, especially in Southeast Asian mathematics education, remains underexplored. This gap is significant because understanding cultural adaptation is essential for AI tools to effectively enhance learning in diverse classrooms. This study examines how AI can be integrated into mathematics education across Southeast Asia, focusing on specific cultural practices such as communal learning styles, respect for hierarchical structures and the role of local languages, as well as educators' perspectives.Design/methodology/approachA mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative data from questionnaires with qualitative insights from interviews with educators across ten Southeast Asian countries. The study included 543 respondents in total with the numbers is varying in each country, targeting high school teachers experienced in using AI in teaching.FindingsThe findings revealed that educators in Singapore are most confident in AI's adaptability to cultural contexts, whereas those in Myanmar and Laos face challenges due to infrastructure limitations. Interviews highlighted the need to customize AI tools to align with students' cultural backgrounds, including language preferences and traditional learning practices, for effective implementation. Teacher training and access to technology, especially in rural areas, were also identified as critical factors.Originality/valueThis study addresses a critical gap in understanding AI's cultural implications in Southeast Asia, providing insights into how cultural values, language and educational practices influence the integration of AI in mathematics education. The findings highlight the need for culturally responsive AI tools and targeted improvements in infrastructure and teacher training for successful implementation.
Towards Explainable Group Formation by Knowledge Map based Genetic Algorithm;"Flanagan, Brendan; Liang, Changhao; Majumdar, Rwitajit; Ogata, Hiroaki";2021;IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (ICALT 2021);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/ICALT52272.2021.00119;;;;Yes;In recent years, machine learning of increasing complexity is being applied to problems in education. However, there is an increasing call for transparency and understanding into how the results of complex models are derived, leading to explainable AI gaining attention. The application of machine learning to automated group formation for collaborative work from learning system logs and other data has been progressing. Building on previous research in this field, we propose a group formation method that is based on a combination of course knowledge structures, reading behavior, and assessment analysis to create optimal heterogenous and homogeneous working groups using a genetic algorithm. The characteristics of each group are presented for explanation as a visualized knowledge map showing the strengths and weaknesses of each group, and are in the structure form of curriculum. We also present a case study of applying the method to junior high school mathematics log data, and provide explanation in a visualized form of standardized curriculum of group characteristics that are often referenced for learning design by teachers.
Investigating the Impact of the AI-Supported 5E (AI-s5E) Instructional Model on Spatial Ability;"Gurefe, Nejla; Aktas, Gulfem Sarpkaya; Oksuz, Hava";2024;BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/bs14080682;;;Yes;Yes;Improving students' spatial abilities is an important goal in education. Spatial ability is a skill needed in many fields, such as science, mathematics, engineering, and architecture. Since this ability can be improved through training, this study adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effects of an artificial intelligence-supported 5E (AI-s5E) instructional model on students' spatial visualization, spatial relationships, and spatial orientation performances that explain their spatial abilities. A total of 43 students from two classes at a secondary school in western Turkey were recruited to participate in this study. One of the classes was the experimental group (f = 23), which adopted the AI-s5E approach, and the other class was the control group (f = 20), which adopted the traditional teaching model. The results showed that the integration of the AI-s5E instructional approach into education improved students' spatial abilities and sub-dimensions. In light of the findings, it can be recommended that AI applications, which have a positive and significant impact on spatial skills, can be integrated into teachers' lessons and even included in curriculum programs.
Exploring Artificial Intelligence-enhanced Electronic Design Process Logs: Empowering High School Engineering Teachers;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a general theoretical framework often used for teaching engineering, STEM, invention, and even science, particularly in K-12 education. While most EDPs used in education are depicted as linear or circular, true design processes are highly creative, non-linear, and often involve ill-posed problem statements and solution criteria. These traits make it particularly difficult for high school engineering teachers, who tend to skip over key elements of human-centered design, where an engineer takes time to understand the problem through research, interviews, prior literature searches, market analysis, and brainstorming???the steps where diversity of thought and experience are of the most value. In addition, it can be hard to provide students with real-time feedback due to the asynchronous nature of group work and large class sizes, and students may not feel comfortable asking for feedback on incomplete work. This project will develop and pilot an artificial intelligence (AI) enhanced Engineering Design Process Log to help students navigate the design process, provide real-time feedback, and encourage meaningful documentation of each step of the process. This project does not propose to replace teachers with AI; rather, the project will explore a novel approach in which AI systems assist teachers in the creation of instructional modules that adhere to EDP best practices. This project is a collaboration between researchers at Georgia Tech???s College of Computing (GT CoC) and researchers at Georgia Tech???s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing (CEISMC). This project is a teaching-focused technological innovation, representing an early exploration into AI-enhanced design pedagogy. Specifically, the project will: 1) Improve upon an existing web-based Engineering Design Process Log (EDPL) by engaging in teacher user studies, 2) Design, pilot, and implement an AI-based authoring and tutoring system for teachers to customize feedback for students and for specific projects with domain expertise, 3) Design and provide professional development opportunities for alpha and beta testing teachers, and 4) Assess the impact of an AI-based EDP Log (AI-EDPL) on engineering design pedagogy and classroom practice. The AI-EDPL software system will use concepts initially pioneered for intelligent tutoring systems, but applied to scaffolding the creation of custom, teacher-made instructional materials that adhere to best practices in design process pedagogy assessment. Unlike many other educational domains, engineering design problems vary widely in scope and solution pathways, which means there will not be a one-size-fits-all tutoring system that can provide feedback to students. This project will examine (a) whether artificial intelligence can support and scaffold teachers in the creation of the necessary models and knowledge structures needed to scaffold and support learners, and, (b) what professional development teachers need to be successful in developing these models. A multi-phased approach will be used, using value-sensitive design processes from the field of human computer interaction to develop minimalist functional systems that can be tested with teachers in classrooms. In order for AI to help teachers, who do not have a lot of time to tinker with software, they must be able to express their intentions in natural language, which must be automatically converted into functional approximations of the task models that can be easily edited. This project will build on best practices in design theory and pedagogy, design documentation, design instruction, design assessment, and AI tutoring to create a one-of-a-kind technology suitable for engineering design instruction at the high school level. It represents a first attempt at providing real-time feedback in a computational setting for an open-ended design challenge, and it does so without marginalizing or diminishing the role of the instructor in the engineering classroom. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NMHU-BioPACIFIC MIP collaboration in design, synThesis and applications of metal-organic hybrid biomaterials;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU) is a small liberal arts university in Northern New Mexico. It has a student body composed of 53.6% Hispanic Americans and 66.4% women. Many of these students are from low-income first-generation college families. This proposal presents a partnership with the NSF-supported BioPolymers, Automated Cellular Infrastructure, Flow, and integrated Chemistry Materials Innovation Platform (BioPACIFIC MIP) at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Faculty in chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, geology, and chemical engineering will provide materials science education and hands-on training for research to students from underrepresented groups. The Partnership in Research and Education for Materials (PREM) pathway, developed with collaborative efforts from NMHU, UCSB and UCLA, will focus on recruitment, retention, and degree attainment for the students. Professional development for students will take place throughout the year both at NMHU as well as in the BioPACIFIC MIP Summer School. At BioPACIFIC MIP PREM students will have networking opportunities at multiple levels including with community leaders, faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdocs as well as peer-to-peer. The NMHU???BioPACIFIC MIP PREM will systematically engage high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postgraduates at all partner institutions. In New Mexico, at the high school level, the PREM will utilize dual credits for high school students and the Achieving in Research, Mathematics and Science (ARMAS) Center to encourage and engage students from underrepresented groups in science education programs. At NMHU, in collaboration with BioPACIFIC MIP, two new materials science courses, devoted to an in-depth understanding of materials structure and properties, will be designed. The PREM program will involve at least 12 BS or MS NMHU PREM students per year. The research outcome will be disseminated through publications, with a goal of at least 10 articles per year in peer reviewed journals with student co-authors in at least 80% of those publications. This project is partially supported with co-funding from the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The proposed research will include machine learning, materials synThesis, high-throughput automated chemistry/biosynThesis, and applications of organic-inorganic materials. By bridging machine learning and synthetic chemistry (closing the design loop), a wider combination of bioinspired building blocks will be designed to go beyond the current biomaterial landscape. This will enable the use of two or more organic/inorganic components in one material which is necessary to tune structural, optical, electronic, and magnetic properties of a multi-component material. Resultant small molecules, organic polymers, and organic-inorganic porous materials will also allow for designing of biosensors, drug delivery systems, materials for chiral chromatography and templates for polymerization. The partnership between NMHU and BioPACIFIC MIP will allow NMHU re-searchers and students to establish a new area of materials research at NMHU. Development of new expertise will be supported by access of NMHU faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students to scientific expertise and advanced instrumentation at BioPACIFIC MIP to rapidly accelerate discovery of materials. The collaborative teams will hold research-focused group meetings via real-time video teleconferencing. Students will visit BioPACIFIC MIP laboratories. Two to three NMHU undergraduates will travel to BioPACIFIC MIP each year for summer research. One or more NMHU MS students will go to BioPACIFIC MIP to take courses and do research for one semester, and a PREM Annual Retreat will be held each year, alternating between NMHU and UCSB. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
A Study on the Improvement of School Mathematics Curriculum for SW?AI Education;"Park,, Sang Woo; Hong, Hoo-Jo";2022;The Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;This study is to analyze and review AI based learning contents in school education so that SW?AI education can be conducted in the intelligent information era due to changes in education paradigm. It was intended to present a plan to improve Mathematics Curriculum, focusing on areas including school Practical Arts/Informatics and AI-based learning contents outside the subject for SW?AI education.

A Study on Forecasting Post-enrollment Grades of Students Using Gradient Boosting Decision Tree;"Arasawa, Komei; Matsukawa, Shun; Sugio, Nobuyuki; Sanada, Hirofumi; Takahara, Madoka; Hattori, Shun";2024;HUMAN INTERFACE AND THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION, PT III, HIMI 2024;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-60125-5_2;;;;Yes;The number of dropouts from universities is increasing, and many researchers have claimed that poor academic grade is a major reason that they drop out from the universities. Therefore, there is a need to develop a system that can forecast the post-enrollment grades of the students at an early stage and help the students with poor academic grades. This paper aims to propose a method that forecast whether the rank of Grade Point Average (GPA) after 1 year of a student is in lower in the department based on the machine learning using the feature values, such as his/her study logs on the pre-admission educations of the university, his/her academic grades in high school, and the data on the admission examinations s/he took. In addition, this paper reveals the forecast performance and the explanatory variables that are effective for the task.

The Machine Learning-Based Dropout Early Warning System for Improving the Performance of Dropout Prediction;"Lee, Sunbok; Chung, Jae Young";2019;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app9153093;;;;Yes;"A dropout early warning system enables schools to preemptively identify students who are at risk of dropping out of school, to promptly react to them, and eventually to help potential dropout students to continue their learning for a better future. However, the inherent class imbalance between dropout and non-dropout students could pose difficulty in building accurate predictive modeling for a dropout early warning system. The present study aimed to improve the performance of a dropout early warning system: (a) by addressing the class imbalance issue using the synthetic minority oversampling techniques (SMOTE) and the ensemble methods in machine learning; and (b) by evaluating the trained classifiers with both receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. To that end, we trained random forest, boosted decision tree, random forest with SMOTE, and boosted decision tree with SMOTE using the big data samples of the 165,715 high school students from the National Education Information System (NEIS) in South Korea. According to our ROC and PR curve analysis, boosted decision tree showed the optimal performance."
Duke University Program for Vertically Integrated, Interdisciplinary Reseasrch;;2000;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Abstract Bertozzi The Duke Mathematics Department's VIGRE program was designed with NSF's stated objectives of increas(ing) interdisciplinary activities involving mathematics and encourag(ing) activities aimed at broadening undergraduate and graduate curricula in mind while maintaining existing disciplinary strengths. Interdisciplinary research is a perfect setting for vertical integration and the Duke Mathematics Department has existing disciplinary strengths in algebraic geometry, analysis, differential equations, differential geometry, numerical analysis, probability, and topology. We will use the team research model to enhance our graduate training program and our undergraduate and postdoctoral programs. Graduate and undergraduate students will confront research problems early in their careers and will have ongoing exposure to them through their respective programs. Advanced graduate students and postdocs will take on new roles as project leaders in vertically integrated research seminar courses and in team research groups. All students and postdocs will develop skills in computation, communication and collaboration as part of their mathematical training, thereby broadening the range of opportunities available to them as mathematical scientists. The goal of the program is to have students and postdocs completing their programs with a broad scientific knowledge and clear understanding of the inner workings of a scientific team, as well as an academic research and teaching portfolio that will enhance their career advancement potential. In the undergraduate program our goal is to increase students' enthusiasm for mathematics and its role in research at all levels of their training at Duke. We will increase the number of first-year and major seminars aimed at exposing students to current topics of research. Current seminar course topics include cryptography, physiology and medicine, geometry, and optimization. New topics include heart dynamics, gravitational lensing, and artificial intelligence. A new Perspectives on Science seminar aimed at first-year women interested in mathematics, statistics and computer science will expose young students to current research of senior scientists, postdocs, and graduate students. The cornerstone of the undergraduate VIGRE program is a new two-year intensive research program, entitled `Practical Research for Undergraduates with VIGRE' (PRUV, pronounced prove), for advanced mathematics majors, which integrates course work, summer internships in a vertically integrated environment, and senior theses. These improvements in the undergraduate program are targeted to involve more students in research activities. We expect that one outcome will be more senior honors theses on research problems and more students choosing to apply to graduate school in the mathematical sciences. For the graduate program, the VIGRE grant will be combined with Duke resources to support all first year students without teaching duties. After the first year, the strongest VIGRE-eligible students will receive a one semester-per-year teaching release in order to direct more of their energy towards research. All graduate students in the graduate program will have the opportunity to work in vertically integrated research teams, including postdocs, graduate students PRUV students, and at least one mathematics professor. Those working on interdisciplinary problems will also collaborate with at least one professor from another discipline. Current interdisciplinary activities include deforestation and aerosol dynamics, geometric computing, granular flow, heart dynamics, liquid films, photonic band gaps, physiology and medicine, string theory, and uncertainty in porous flow, with Duke collaborators in the School of the Environment, Computer Science, Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Institute for Statistics and Decision Sciences. Graduate teacher training currently begins in the first-year with students supervising calculus laboratories. In order to shorten time to degree and increase retention, we will postpone teaching responsibilities and teacher training by one year for all graduate students. This will enable all first year graduate students to focus on fundamental course work required to pass the qualifying exam before the beginning of year two. The current teacher-training program will be expanded to include alternative teaching experiences for students and postdocs including outreach to high school teachers, and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students. A new computational requirement will be part of their first-year curriculum. The graduate students currently run a weekly seminar with talks aimed at first and second year graduate students given by graduate students and postdocs. PRUV undergraduates will be encouraged to attend this seminar. VIGRE postdocs will play a leadership role in the overall program. Each year, for the first three years, two VIGRE postdocs will be hired for three year terms. These positions will parallel existing Duke funded Assistant Research Professors (ARP). VIGRE Postdocs will have the opportunity to play a strong leadership role in the team research groups including mentoring graduate students and undergraduates and developing a well-defined independent research program. They will also have the opportunity to take on a significant supporting role in at least one of the following activities: (1) coordinating research seminars and workshops, (2) co-supervising summer PRUV students and graduate student internships, (3) helping undergraduates and graduate students in a writing workshop. Postdocs and students will collaborate with high school teachers in Project CHISEL `Carolina High School Educational Leadership project'. They will design modules for classroom use that will introduce high school students to the use of mathematics in current research. Funding for this activity was provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the MPS Office for Multidisciplinary Activity.

A comparative study on the external & internal structure of mathematics curriculum between Korea and Japan : Focusing on the aspects of recent revisions;"Kwon,, Oh Nam; Lee,, Kyungwon; Lee,, Ahran; Chaereen, Han";2019;The Mathematical Education;research-article;WoS;10.7468/mathedu.2019.58.2.187;;;;Yes;This study aims to investigate the aspects of revision in the external and internal structure of curriculum and documentation in Korea and Japan and to propose the direction and task to enhance the current framework of the national curriculum. Japan has been selected for comparison in that it explicitly prepared social changes such as the dramatic evolution of artificial intelligence and population aging in its new curriculum. Therefore, various aspects of revision were analyzed the 2009 & 2015 revised mathematics curriculum of Korea and the 2008 & 2017 mathematics curriculum of Japan respectively in the elementary, middle, and high school grade bands. Then, the differences between the two countries were identified through comparison. First, the structure of the mathematics curriculum in Japan was connected with the general guidelines more tightly than Korea, and the external structure of the mathematics curriculum stayed consistently after the revision. Second, contrary to Korea, which pursued the appropriateness and reduction of mathematical content, Japanese mathematics curriculum has been pursuing detailed contents both quantitatively and qualitatively. Lastly, Japan emphasized statistical problem-solving ability.Based on this, we suggested considering of consistency in the structure curriculum documentation, detailing contents of the curriculum, and strengthening of statistical education.
Integrating Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Game Design, and Educational Assessment in a STEM+C Curriculum;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Integrating computing into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education at the K-12 level is critical to creating a competitive, innovative workforce that is capable of the computational thinking needs of the future. Efforts to increase intrinsic interest in math and data science have proven difficult to apply evenly across gender, race, and socio-economic factors. This research project will assist in creating a more stable, ethical, and inclusive data science workforce by broadening interest in data science to a more diverse population of students. This research spans the fields of game design, human computer interaction, machine learning, curriculum design and educational assessment by integrating a STEM+C based curriculum directly into Minecraft. It advances knowledge in game-based learning and produces an infrastructure that will serve as a vital computing resource for middle and high school educators that will be sustained beyond the current project. As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). A key initiative of STEM+C is to cultivate the skills for the next generation of data scientists, information scientists, and engineers in the nation. A virtual world provides a technique to engage the next generation of students in a fun and intuitive manner. A virtual world is developed around fundamental activities, or gameplay atoms, which reflect the experiential learning process through a trial and error feedback loop. These atoms are combined in multiple ways with slight variations to form a group of related activities referred to as game mechanics. These activities will be mapped to education standards to introduce or reinforce various STEM+C concepts. This project uses design-based research methodology to iteratively develop and refine the activities through meaningfully integrating feedback from educational stakeholders, including teachers and students. Key outcomes from this research include changes in students' interest, attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy in STEM+C, engagement in collaborative open-ended solution making, and achievement in related computing and mathematics concepts. This research will help broaden interest in computing to a more diverse pool of students.

Exploring the Integration of Artificial Intelligence-Based ChatGPT into Mathematics Instruction: Perceptions, Challenges, and Implications for Educators;"Egara, Felix Oromena; Mosimege, Mogege";2024;EDUCATION SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/educsci14070742;;;Yes;Yes;This research investigates how secondary school mathematics educators in the Nsukka Education Zone, Enugu State, Nigeria, perceive the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based ChatGPT into teaching mathematics. The study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods strategy, starting with a systematic survey and followed by detailed interviews. The Mathematics Teachers' Awareness and Perceptions of AI-based ChatGPT Questionnaire (MTAPACQ) used in this study was adapted from an existing online survey and administered to 80 mathematics teachers, who were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure varied representation across different local government areas. The survey explored teachers' awareness, utilisation, and perceptions of ChatGPT. Following the quantitative phase, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of five teachers who were familiar with ChatGPT to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings indicate limited awareness of ChatGPT, with only 17% demonstrating familiarity with the technology. The infrequent utilisation of ChatGPT in mathematics teaching is mainly associated with this limited awareness. Teachers who integrate ChatGPT Report positive outcomes, including improved teaching effectiveness, heightened student engagement, and enhanced comprehension of complex concepts. Nevertheless, the overall perceptions of the tool's impact on mathematics teaching and learning are moderate. The identified challenges in relation to integration include technical adaptability, curriculum alignment, and the need for customisation to accommodate diverse learning styles. This study emphasises the significance of continuous professional development and ongoing support for teachers to integrate AI-based ChatGPT into mathematics instruction proficiently. The insights derived from the findings hold value for educators, policymakers, and technology developers aspiring to elevate the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics education.
Collaborative Research: Integrating Language-Based AI Across the High School Curriculum to Create Diverse Pathways to AI-Rich Careers;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous industries and generating enormous wealth. K-12 is the critical stage for youth to develop knowledge of and interest in AI. This project will leverage the interdisciplinarity of AI to create learning opportunities for secondary students from diverse backgrounds. Focusing on natural language-based AI, this project will develop and research a novel AI Across the Curriculum program that integrates AI concepts and practices into the existing high school curriculum. The project team will develop and test a two-hour introductory module and three five-hour modules for mathematics, English language arts (ELA), and history, as well as a 60-hour professional development program for teachers to develop the competencies required to implement the modules. Teachers in math, ELA, and history will implement the modules in a coordinated fashion to offer learning experiences that are coherent across the different disciplines to their students. During the project, 12 teachers and 900 students will directly benefit from participation in the program. The output of the project will advance national prosperity through AI workforce development by enabling high schools to provide high-quality AI education to all students, especially African Americans, Latinx, and females, who are the underrepresented and underserved groups in the field of AI. The project will be led by an interdisciplinary team of AI developers and educators, STEM and humanities educators, learning scientists and designers, and experts on diversity, equity, and inclusion at the Concord Consortium, Carnegie Mellon University, and North Carolina State University. The team will partner with the San Joaquin County Office of Education in California and the Maryland Center for Computing Education and work closely with two school districts, one in CA and one in MD, that serve student populations underrepresented and underserved in the field of AI. Researchers will address three research questions: 1) How do students??? social and disciplinary identities shape their participation in learning of AI knowledge and AI-rich careers? Guided by the intersectional identity theory, the project will capture eight focal students??? learning processes with repeated interviews, video, audio, and screencast recordings, and computer logs. These data will be analyzed using the personal narratives framework and ethnomethodological and conversation-analytic approaches. 2) What and how are new ideas generated by teachers as they seek to coordinate their efforts to integrate AI across the curriculum? Based on the community of practice theory, the project will capture teachers??? idea generation and transaction processes with Professional Development (PD) recordings, online communications, and interviews. These data will be analyzed using the idea authorship framework. 3) To what extent, for whom, and under what conditions does the AI Across the Curriculum program support students to develop knowledge of and interest in AI-rich careers? The demographic and academic backgrounds of 900 students and 12 teachers will be collected via surveys to determine the impact of this approach. An AI & Machine Learning Core Concepts Questionnaire and an AI-Rich Careers Questionnaire will be administered before and after the curriculum. These data will be analyzed quantitatively to determine to what extent, for whom, and under what conditions the modules are beneficial. Through research publications and professional learning resources, the project will increase the capacity of educators and researchers to advance AI education. All technologies, curriculum modules, assessments, and PD materials will be freely available to the public. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Impacts of ICT-related factors on students' digital reading literacy: Evidence from high-performing Asian countries and regions;"Li, Chenyang; Chen, Fu";2024;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-024-12501-9;;;;Yes;Digital reading literacy has emerged as a pivotal factor contributing significantly to teenagers' academic and future career successes. Few studies have focused on how ICT-related factors shape students' digital reading literacy in non-English-speaking contexts. This study explored the impacts of ICT-related home and school factors on digital reading literacy, analyzing data from four non-English-speaking Asian countries and regions participating in PISA 2018, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Macau, and Taiwan. In addition, we compared the identified influential factors between these four countries and regions, as well as with previous studies, for a comprehensive understanding of ICT-related factors of digital reading. The Random Forest model was used to rank the importance of ICT-related factors and identify the top 10 most influential factors of digital reading. The most important ICT-related home factors were parents' attitudes and participation in digital reading activities. Among ICT-related school factors, the time of ICT use in school, the subject that classes use ICT, and the number of computers were found to be negatively associated with students' digital reading literacy. However, the capacity of schools to use digital devices to improve learning and teaching was positively associated with students' digital reading literacy.
Using artificial intelligence in education: decision tree learning results in secondary school students based on cold and hot executive functions;"Escolano-Perez, Elena; Losada, Jose Luis";2024;HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.1057/s41599-024-04040-y;;;Yes;Yes;Improving educational quality is a universal concern. Despite efforts made in this regard, learning outcomes have not improved sufficiently. Therefore, further investigation is needed on this issue, adopting new perspectives (conceptual and analytical) to facilitate the understanding and design of effective actions. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of executive functions (considering both cognitive and affective processes) and their interactions on learning outcomes in Language and Literature and Mathematics in Spanish students, through the use of artificial intelligence, based on the machine learning approach, and more specifically, the decision tree technique. A total of 173 students in compulsory secondary education (12-17 years old) from the same educational institution participated. The school's educational counsellor provided information on student executive function levels by completing the BRIEF2 questionnaire for each participant. She also Reported on the learning outcomes achieved by students in the subjects of interest for this research (Language and Literature and Mathematics). R software was used to model the regression trees. The results revealed groups of students characterised by different profiles, i.e., by different combinations of difficulties in various executive functions and varying levels of learning outcomes in each academic area. However, regardless of the academic area considered (Language and Literature or Mathematics), working memory was identified as the most relevant executive function in all of the students' learning outcomes. Understanding the combination of executive functions that predict learning outcomes in each group of students is important since it enables teachers and other educational professionals, policymakers and researchers to provide individualised educational resources according to the diverse student profiles and needs. It constitutes an effective mechanism to improve students' learning results and, ultimately, to enhance an equitable and more effective educational system.
Digital vs. Analog Learning-Two Content-Similar Interventions and Learning Outcomes;"Fleissner-Martin, Juliane; Bogner, Franz X.; Paul, Juergen";2023;FORESTS;Article;WoS;10.3390/f14091807;;;;Yes;"The digitization of classrooms has enormously changed teaching during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The rapid introduction of tablet classes subsequently raised questions about potential learning outputs, as only a few studies had produced quite contradicting outcomes. Consequently, our study was set up to monitor cognitive learning outcomes of conventional and digital teaching interventions by explicitly paying attention to short- and long-term knowledge retention rates. Both modules covered the very same classroom content in focusing on the curricular content of the forest ecosystem. Subjects were eighth-graders from seven Bavarian secondary schools (analog: n = 74; digital: n = 225). We analyzed the knowledge gained by applying a multiple-choice questionnaire (online, 25 items) in a pre-post-retention design. For the statistical analyses SPSS was used, and a Rasch analysis was based on the ACERQuest software (Version 2.1). The Rasch calibration of the ad hoc knowledge items assured solid scores (Rel = 0.72). Both interventions significantly increased knowledge (analog and digital: p < 0.001; Cohen's d: d(analog) = 0.59, d(digital) = 0.42) compared to the pre-test scores. Even after 6-9 weeks, there was no significant drop in the acquired knowledge scores (analog: p = 0.619; digital: p = 0.092) compared to the immediate post-test observed. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the knowledge levels reached after both interventions. The knowledge scores showed typical learning profiles of earlier studies including its consistency even after several weeks. Since no significant differences appeared for the knowledge gain of both groups, the kind of teaching seemingly does not originate any influence independent of participation in the digital or analog module. The same seems to be valid for noteBook entry options."
Analysis of Engineering Tool Utilization in the TextBook of the Revised 2015 Curriculum;"Yeon, Yoon Ju; Jin, Kim Kyeong";2023;Journal of The Korean Association of Artificial Intelligence Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the engineering tools used in the 2015 revised curriculum textBook to help students understand the new subject and to find ways to efficiently utilize it in schools. In this study, in order to examine the use of engineering tools in the textBook of , among the five textBooks recognized for , the top 3 textBooks with a high application rate in the current high school field were set as the target of the study. This study focused on the area of ‘classification and prediction’ where the use of engineering tools was prominent in the subject of and analyzed how each textBook dealt with it. As a result of the analysis, there was a difference in the use and type of engineering tools among the textBooks, which seemed to be due to the characteristics of the approved textBooks rather than the state-approved textBooks. In addition, it was confirmed that all textBooks faithfully reflected the teaching, learning, and evaluation directions presented in the study on the development of the subject draft in the use of engineering tools, but it was found that learning how to use artificial intelligence in mathematics subjects should be preceded by learning to understand the computational thinking process.
Analysis of Text Data Representation and Classification of ‘Artificial Intelligence Mathematics’ TextBook in 2015 Revised Curriculum;"Jin, Kim Kyeong; Yeon, Yoon Ju; Hyun, Lee Chul";2023;Journal of The Korean Association of Artificial Intelligence Education;research-article;WoS;10.52618/aied.2022.4.1.1;;;;Yes;The purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the content and system of the text data analysis of the 'Artificial Intelligence Mathematics' textBooks of the 2015 revised curriculum currently being used in schools, to contribute to reducing confusion in school sites where differences in learning content occur due to textBook selection, and to seek ways to improve. The subjects of the analysis were five textBooks on 'Artificial Intelligence Mathematics', which is a high school approved textBook according to the 2015 revised curriculum. The analysis framework was constructed by synthesizing the curriculum's 'achievement standards', 'achievement standards explanation and implementation plan', and 'teaching and learning methods and notes' to extract the 'main content elements that make up the achievement standards'. Based on the analysis framework, we tried to analyze qualitatively as well as quantitatively how the main content elements of the achievement standards were reflected in the five textBooks, and explored the cases of each representative textBook. As a result of the analysis, it was found that it is necessary to explicitly present the definition of terms, the purpose of the analysis and the method of expression and processing accordingly, and to fully explain the intermediate processes required to explain the concepts so that the overall flow can be understood.
MONTO: A Machine-Readable Ontology for Teaching Word Problems in Mathematics;"Lalingkar, Aparna; Ramanathan, Chandrashekar; Ramani, Srinivasan";2015;EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY;Article;WoS;;;;;Yes;The Indian National Curriculum Framework has as one of its objectives the development of mathematical thinking and problem solving ability. However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students' mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use. We describe the MONTO ontology and compare it with some other teaching ontologies described in the literature. We developed and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national curriculum in India, and the results obtained were satisfactory: MONTO was found to be 94% robust against unseen problems in different curricula for the same domain.

AGILEST approach: Using machine learning agents to facilitate kinesthetic learning in STEM education through real-time touchless hand interaction;"Iqbal, Muhammad Zahid; Campbell, Abraham G.";2023;TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS ReportS;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.teler.2022.100034;;;Yes;Yes;There is an increasing interest in creating interactive learning applications using innovative interaction technologies, especially in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects. Recent developments in machine learning have allowed for nearly perfect hand-tracking recognition, introducing a touchless modality for interaction within Augmented Reality (AR) environments. However, the research community has not explored the pedagogical approach of Kinesthetic Learning or Learning by Doing , hand tracking, and machine learning agents combined with Augmented Reality technology. Fundamentally, this exploration of touchless interaction technologies has taken on new importance in the new post-COVID world. Meanwhile, machine learning has gained attention for its ability to enhance personalized learning and play a vital new role as a virtual instructor. This paper proposes a novel approach called the AGILEST approach, which uses machine learning Agents to facilitate interactive kinesthetic learning in STEM education through touchless interaction. The first case study for this approach will be an AR learning application for chemistry. This application uses real-time touchless hand interaction for kinesthetic learning and uses a machine learning agent to act as both trainer and assessor of the user. The evaluation of this research has been conducted remotely through a usability study with expert reviewers, which includes 15 young researchers with peer-reviewed work in Human-Computer Interaction & AR and 2 subject experts STEM teachers at the secondary school level. The usability evaluation through NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), Perceived Ease of Use (PUEU), and Perceived Usefulness (PU) with expert reviewers provide positive feedback about this approach for productive learning gain, engagement and interactiveness in learning STEM subjects.
Crowdsourced Water Level Monitoring in Kenya's Sondu-Miriu Basin-Who Is The Crowd?;"Weeser, Bjorn; Graf, Jan; Njue, Naomi K.; Cerutti, Paolo; Rufino, Mariana C.; Breuer, Lutz; Jacobs, Suzanne R.";2021;FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.3389/feart.2020.602422;;;;Yes;Citizen science is gaining popularity as a way to engage people to participate in environmental projects. In addition to potential challenges regarding data quality and the choice of variables, a key factor in the success of participatory monitoring projects is the active participation of volunteers, the citizen scientists. To learn more about the motivation of citizen scientists to participate and their socio-economic background, a telephone survey was implemented with participants of a citizen science water level monitoring program in the Sondu-Miriu basin, western Kenya. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and random forest models to elucidate the characteristics of the participant population, underlying motivations, and the challenges and opportunities to develop recommendations for sustainable community-based water monitoring programs. As citizen scientists who engaged long-term were 30-49 years old, had primary or secondary school education and passed by the monitoring station frequently, targeting sensitization activities at people with such background could increase participation in community-based water monitoring. Sensitization meetings were key in engaging long-term volunteers, but participants indicated that continued feedback through education and communication of the project findings is required to keep volunteers motivated. The use of cellphone credit to submit data was identified as challenge for participation, highlighting the need for data submission methods that do not incur costs for the participants. Greater volunteer support could also be achieved by active involvement of the members of Water Resource Users Associations, since membership increased the likelihood of continuous engagement in water monitoring under the participants. Furthermore, many participants indicated that their motivation was to help water management and conservation, as most people rely directly on rivers for their water supply. Providing a platform to contribute to better water resources management could therefore result in direct benefits (e.g., improved water supply) for the participants, and thus an incentive to participate actively.
CAREER: Harnessing the Continuum for Big Data: Partial Differential Equations, Calculus of Variations, and Machine Learning;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Machine learning has broad applications in everyday life, such as self-driving cars, medical image analysis, and speech recognition. Recent years have seen tremendous advances in the ability of machine learning algorithms to replicate and even exceed human performance on many of these tasks. However, we still lack a theoretical understanding of when large scale machine learning will work well to discover interesting patterns and structure in data, and when it will fail to do so and overfit. These problems have recently manifested in adversarial hacking of deep neural networks, which poses risks in sensitive applications where data privacy and security are paramount. The objective of this project is to use the theory of partial differential equations and the calculus of variations to study foundational problems in machine learning and data science, and develop new, more efficient, algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. The project will advance data science education by developing an annual summer school for high school students on graph-based learning, mentoring high-school students from the University of Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program, developing graduate courses on current research in graph-based learning, and supporting the participation of women and underrepresented groups in all aspects of the project. The overall goal of the project is to use partial differential equation (PDE) continuum limits for discrete machine learning problems to analyze existing algorithms, develop new algorithms with better performance guarantees, and make new connections between machine learning and PDEs. A major focus of the project is graph-based learning, where discrete learning algorithms on graphs can be interpreted as discretizations of continuum PDEs, and properties of those PDEs (e.g., regularity and well-posedness) convey information about the learning problem and can lead to new algorithms founded on strong theoretical principles. In particular, the project will (1) develop and study a new algorithm, called Poisson learning, for graph-based semi-supervised learning at very low labeling rates, (2) draw new connections between stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and viscosity solutions of nonlinear PDEs, showing that SGD has the ability to select good minimizers in ill-posed problems, (3) use ideas from classical elliptic regularity theory to prove interior Lipschitz regularity for solutions of graph-based learning problems on random geometric graphs, (4) prove generalization bounds for graph-based learning in low label-rate regimes, including the active learning setting, and (5) develop a consistency theory for learning problems on directed graphs, such as ranking algorithms. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Frontiers in Matrix Sketching;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Advances in sensing and storage technology have increased the ability to collect and share huge amounts of data. From satellite imagery, to genetic data, to web content, richer datasets offer the promise of improved data-driven discovery and decision making across science, engineering, and industry. Realizing this promise, however, requires enormous computational effort. The goal of this project is to democratize the data revolution by developing new algorithms to efficiently process the world's largest datasets, without the need for the world's largest supercomputers. To do so, the investigator and his team will study a powerful algorithmic technique known as matrix sketching. The key idea is to quickly compress a large dataset (represented as a matrix of numbers) down to its most essential information by eliminating redundancy and noise. The compressed data can then be efficiently digested by downstream algorithms for machine learning and statistical inference. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in matrix sketching by taking an interdisciplinary approach, combining tools from theoretical computer science with methods from computational and applied mathematics. The project also involves a major educational component, aimed at improving U.S. mathematics education through closer ties with applications in STEM fields. The project will support an international high-school applied-mathematics competition, the development of curricular material and workshops for high-school educators, and course development to better prepare university students for careers in algorithms, machine learning, and data science. To advance research in matrix sketching, the project is centered around three main objectives, each involving problems of practical importance, as well as motivating theoretical questions that will more broadly impact algorithms research. The first objective is to develop sketching techniques that move beyond low-rank matrix compression, which only captures information about the largest-magnitude components of a matrix???s spectrum. Motivated by emerging applications in network science, deep learning, and computational physics, the research team is developing techniques that instead capture coarse information about the entire spectrum of a matrix. The second objective is to develop methods that allow for higher accuracy by combining existing sketching algorithms with powerful tools for interactive refinement. The goal is to design algorithms with runtimes that depend logarithmically, instead of polynomially, on problem accuracy. The final objective is to extend the impact of sketching beyond applications where data is over-abundant, by addressing important problems where sufficient, high-quality data remains a luxury. The theoretical tools of matrix sketching and data subsampling are being used to design smarter data-collection strategies for the ???small-data??? regime, advancing the state-of-the-art in active learning and experimental design. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Assessment of predictions of hydrologic function based on aquatic DNA fragments;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;For the safety and security of the public, it is important to be able to estimate how much water flows through rivers and streams at locations where no gauges of flow exist. In these places, the collection of some other type of information can be remarkably useful in understanding flow patterns. This project investigates how fragments of biological material can be used in predicting river and stream flows. The biological material investigated in this project is the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of microbes found within water samples. This material can be collected and analyzed quickly, easily, and inexpensively. By using advanced biological techniques, the DNA found in streams can be translated into the relative abundance of different types of microbes. This project is based on the understanding that different environmental conditions, including flow patterns in rivers, cause different populations of microbes to become more or less abundant. This project supports an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students to develop new tools that relate stream and river microbes to hydrologic flow patterns. The project partners with a local organization focused on connecting under-represented communities with science professionals. This project focuses on the collection and sequencing of streamwater DNA at a suite of long-term gauging stations spanning a range ecohydrologic conditions across the Pacific Northwest. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, the relative abundance of different microbial community members is quantified at each location, and patterns in community composition is related to river flows with machine learning techniques. These methods are then extended to regional and national level datasets of streamwater microbiome composition to determine the macroscale hydrologic information contained within streamwater DNA at different scales. For the duration of this project, a team consisting of high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students is engaged in advanced biological, hydrologic, and machine learning techniques to investigate connections between streamwater DNA and watershed function. Both hydrologic and microbial tools and techniques developed through this project will be disseminated to the wider community in a variety of forms, including traditional scholarly outlets and as open-source interactive electronic text for general education about hydrology. This project includes training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for students from high school to the PhD level. The project partners with a local organization focused on connecting under-represented communities with STEM professionals. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Individual Predictors of Response to A Behavioral Activation-Based Digital Smoking Cessation Intervention: A Machine Learning Approach;"Huang, Siyuan; Wahlquist, Amy; Dahne, Jennifer";2024;SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE;Article;WoS;10.1080/10826084.2024.2369155;;;;Yes;Background: Depression is prevalent among individuals who smoke cigarettes and increases risk for relapse. A previous clinical trial suggests that Goal2Quit, a behavioral activation-based smoking cessation mobile app, effectively increases smoking abstinence and reduces depressive symptoms. Objective: Secondary analyses were conducted on these trial data to identify predictors of success in depression-specific digitalized cessation interventions. Methods: Adult who smoked cigarettes (age = 38.4 +/- 10.3, 53% women) were randomized to either use Goal2Quit for 12 weeks (N = 103), paired with a 2-week sample of nicotine replacement therapy (patch and lozenge) or to a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) control (N = 47). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was utilized to identify a subset of baseline variables predicting either smoking or depression intervention outcomes. The retained predictors were then fitted via linear regression models to determine relations to each intervention outcome. Results: Relative to TAU, only individuals who spent significant time using Goal2Quit (56 +/- 46 min) were more likely to reduce cigarette use by at least 50% after 12 weeks, whereas those who spent minimal time using Goal2Quit (10 +/- 2 min) did not exhibit significant changes. An interaction between educational attainment and treatment group revealed that, as compared to TAU, only app users with an educational degree beyond high school exhibited significant reductions in depression. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of tailoring depression-specific digital cessation interventions to individuals' unique engagement needs and educational level. This study provides a potential methodological template for future research aimed at personalizing technology-based treatments for cigarette users with depressive symptoms.
Data Capture and Multimodal Learning Analytics Focused on Engagement With a New Wearable IoT Approach;"Camacho, Vicente Lopez; Guia, Elena de la; Olivares, Teresa; Flores, M. Julia; Orozco-Barbosa, Luis";2020;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1109/TLT.2020.2999787;;;;Yes;Increasing school dropout rates are a problem in many educational systems, with student disengagement being one significant factor. Learning analytics is a new field with a key role in educational institutions in the coming years. It may help make strategic decisions to reduce student disengagement. The use of technology in educational environments has grown significantly and, with it, awareness of the importance of student engagement. We exploit tracking and wearable technologies to increase user engagement in learning processes, exploring also the area of multimodal learning analytics (MMLA). We use wearables and Internet of Things for education, an interactive and collaborative system designed to improve motivation and learning. This article presents the results obtained in different experiments conducted in a secondary school in a long-term participatory learning context. The captured data were analyzed and used to identify different students' behavior patterns, showing their progress and motivation. Subsequently, from the captured data and aiming at a decision-making phase, we used machine learning techniques and MMLA methodologies to construct models able to explain when student engagement is present, so this knowledge can later be exploited. In particular, we chose decision trees and rule systems based on a set of variables with proven relevance to the problem. The evaluation of this novel engagement classification system confirms the high performance of these variables. The rules obtained, which can be easily interpreted by a nonexpert, help the teacher to observe, analyze, and make decisions with the purpose of fostering engagement.
Antecedent Determination of Factors Affecting Online Learning Experience among Primary Students Using Random Forest Classifier;"Ong, Ardvin Kester S.; Garbo, Jan Gabriel I.; Villaluz, Albert C.";2023;PROCEEDINGS OF THE 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTERS, ICETC 2023;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1145/3629296.3629349;;;;Yes;The COVID-19 pandemic led different institution to shift from traditional learning (face-to-face) to fully online learning as evident among different countries. However, most studies have dealt with different levels of education, mostly in senior high school and college. The generalized findings prompted the under exploration of primary students and their online learning experience. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antecedents of factors affecting online learning experience among primary students. Utilizing the community of inquiry framework, specific factors under social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence were evaluated. To consider the most influential factors, random forest classifier was utilized in this study. Garnering a 92% accuracy rate model, it was seen from the results that the most influential factors would be open communication and social presence, followed by design and organization and the level of understanding among lessons. Lastly, teacher facilitation also had a significant positive effect on the positive online learning experience among primary students. It could be deduced from the results that integrated points among learners, ontime feedbacks and evaluation, promoted feedback among concerns, and positive feedback for activities provided a positive learning experience for online classes among primary students. In addition, important factors such as the ones discussed should be considered in the continuous promotion of online learning among primary students. Proper guidelines, lesson implementation, and response from teachers would promote an effective online learning experience which institutions should highly consider for continuous online learning set-up implementation.
A hybrid genetic algorithm for school timetabling;"Wilke, P; Gröbner, M; Oster, N";2002;AL 2002: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE;"Article; Proceedings Paper";WoS;;;;;Yes;Hybrid Genetic Algorithms apply so called hybrid or repair operators or include problem specific knowledge about the problem domain in their mutation and crossover operators. These operators use local search to repair or avoid illegal or unsuitable assignments or just to improve the quality of the solutions already found.Those Hybrid Genetic Algorithms have been successfully applied to different constraint satisfaction and timetabling problems such as the travelling salesman problem, scheduling problems, employee timetabling or high school timetabling.In this paper we describe a Genetic Algorithm for solving the German school timetabling problem. The Genetic Algorithm uses direct representation of the problem and applies an adapted mutation operator as well as several specific repair operators. We redecode the computed improvements to the genotype which establishes a kind of Lamarckian evolution. One of the problems utilising these hybrid operators is how and when to apply them, i.e. how to set the parameters right to achieve the best results. Different approaches have been started to adjust these parameters in an optimal way, but in most cases these adjustments require additional computing time and consequently are quite costly. We tackled this problem by an adaptation mechanism for the repair operators which can be applied without additional computing time. These operators are switched on when the normal Genetic Algorithm does not yield any more improvements. When the Genetic Algorithm then converges again, a reconfiguration step for the operator parameters guides the search out of the local optimum.

Analysis of generative AI’s mathematical problemsolving performance: Focusing on ChatGPT 4, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Advanced;"Sejun, Oh; Yoon,, Jungeun; Chung,, Yoojin; Cho,, Yoonjoo; Shim,, HyoSup; Kwon,, Oh Nam";2024;The Mathematical Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;As digitalÂ·AI-based teaching and learning is emphasized, discussions on the educational use of generative AI are becoming more active. This study analyzed the mathematical performance of ChatGPT 4, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Advanced on solving examples and problems from five first-year high school math textBooks. As a result of examining the overall correct answer rate and characteristics of each skill for a total of 1,317 questions, ChatGPT 4 had the highest overall correct answer rate of 0.85, followed by Claude 3 Opus at 0.67, and Gemini Advanced at 0.42.By skills, all three models showed high correct answer rates in ‘Find functions’ and ‘Prove’, while relatively low correct answer rates in ‘Explain’ and ‘Draw graphs’. In particular, in ‘Count’, ChatGPT 4 and Claude 3 Opus had a correct answer rate of 1.00, while Gemini Advanced was low at 0.56. Additionally, all models had difficulty in explaining using Venn diagrams and creating images. Based on the research results, teachers should identify the strengths and limitations of each AI model and use them appropriately in class. This study is significant in that it suggested the possibility of use in actual classes by analyzing the mathematical performance of generative AI. It also provided important implications for redefining the role of teachers in mathematics education in the era of artificial intelligence. Further research is needed to develop a cooperative educational model between generative AI and teachers and to study individualized learning plans using AI.
Bringing Digital Multimedia in Mathematics Education;"Dellyiannis, Ioannis; Floros, Andreas; Vlamos, Panayiotis; Arvanitis, Michael; Tanial, Tsiridou";2008;7TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, VOL 1;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;The increased interest for developing new representation techniques and tools for proving and demonstrating basic mathematical propositions and concepts is the forefront of educational research worldwide in the area of e-learning for mathematics. Although many novel ideas have been proposed for illustrating basic mathematical (i.e. geometrical) concepts, currently there is a lack of effective methods to dynamically reproduce an alternative representation of the underlying concepts. The proposed approach introduces valuable explanatory tools for efficiently supporting the learning objectives, enabling students to reach the core of each notion. In this work, a digital multimedia methodology is presented which implements the above dynamic representation approach. Recent, state-of-the-art trends in multimedia technology related to modern two or three-dimensional (2D or 3D) object modelling are utilised in order to efficiently reproduce a virtual mathematical environment in which selected mathematical concepts. Apart from the time-dependent dynamic representation, advanced user interaction features are also supported for determining various representation parameters (such as the view and lighting position, as well as the time resolution / speed). Additionally, accurate 3D sound projection techniques are employed in cases that the spatial sound information enhances the illustrated perceptual effect. For convenient access of the multimedia content, the proposed methodology includes a web interface and a multimedia database, offering advanced searching capabilities. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed multimedia framework, a number of geometrical concepts are selected and applied for the instruction of corresponding high-school and university courses and will be presented in detail. The application of the proposed multimedia approach in these courses has shown that it achieves high student learning rates, even to non-mathematically-literate students, while it allows the teacher / lecturer to explain basic concepts that are otherwise difficult to introduce using conventional media.
Development and Effect Analysis of Future Problem Solving Program based Informatics, Mathematics, Science Convergence Education Teachers’ Training Course using AI for Secondary School Teachers;"Lee, Dagyeom; Youngjun, Lee; Seounghey, Paik";2024;The Journal of Korean Association of Computer Education;research-article;WoS;10.32431/kace.2024.27.5.001;;;;Yes;The 2022 revised curriculum aims to cultivate individuals equipped with digital and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to prepare them for the future society. To achieve this goal, the curriculum emphasizes AI convergence education, where AI is utilized to address real world problems across various subjects, including informatics, science, and mathematics. To effectively implement this education, teachers need to be equipped with the necessary competencies to design and deliver AI convergence education. This study developed a professional development program that integrates informatics, science, and mathematics curriculum using the Future Problem Solving Program, which enables teachers to explore solutions to open-ended social issues through cross-disciplinary collaboration based on creative thinking and teamwork. The 15 periods program, based on the ADDIE model, allowed teachers to experience and design AI convergence education based on the FPSP. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, 30 informatics, science, and mathematics teachers participated in the training, and their AI teaching efficacy and STEAM literacy were measured pre- and post-training. The results indicated that the AI teaching efficacy and STEAM literacy of the participating teachers were significantly improved after the course. These findings suggest that the professional development program integrating informatics, science, and mathematics using the FPSP has a positive impact on teachers' ability to design and implement AI Convergence Education.

A Study on the Prediction Model for the Ratio of Mathematics Low-Performing Students in Middle School Using Machine Learning;"Lee, Jong-Hyun; Cho, Kyoo-Lak";2021;Journal of Educational Technology;research-article;WoS;10.17232/KSET.37.1.095;;;;Yes;Despite the endeavor of education authorities, the ratio of low-performing students continues to increase. Since the learning loss connects and cumulates from elementary to high school, this has become an urgent educational problem to solve. Thus, in order to find out factors affecting low-performing, this study developed models that predict the ratio of middle school low-performing students, and conducted performance analysis and optimization of the prediction models. Data collected was the education public disclosure information from 2009 to 2017, was put into the prediction models developed by 11 machine learning algorithms, and evaluated robustness of the models respectively. Findings were as follows: first, the study gained the median value as categorization criterion of low-performing was 4.7619. Second, according to the information gain index, factors affecting mathematics low-performing in middle school included ‘after school support budget per student’ ‘school budget per student’ ‘the ratio of male/female students’ ‘the number of students participating in after school programs’ in order. Third, random forest prediction model, which has the highest robustness, was identified as an optimal algorithm among the 11 machine learning algorithms utilized in the study. The results of the study confirmed that the prediction model developed by random forest machine learning algorithm was useful to find out factors affecting the ratio of mathematics low-performing students in middle school. However, since variables in the prediction model do not have causality, interpretation with care is required.
Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance;"Cortez, Paulo; Silva, Alice";2008;15TH EUROPEAN CONCURRENT ENGINEERING CONFERENCE/5TH FUTURE BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Although the educational level of the Portuguese population has improved in the last decades, the statistics keep Portugal at Europe's tail end due to its high student failure rates. In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain,in. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school Reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a, good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent's job and education, alcohol consumption). As a, direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.
Tailoring Personalized Mathematics Education for High School Students Using Dynamic Treatment Regimes;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The current math course-taking plan for high school students across much of the United States is not optimized for every student???s success in math, especially in advanced mathematics. In particular, there has been disproportional participation in advanced math courses among different racial/ethnic and income groups. To this end, this research project develops data-driven, personalized math course-taking plans by leveraging recent advances in personalized medicine. In personalized medicine, clinicians, with the help of machine learning, use past and current historical patient data to tailor patient-specific treatment plans. In a similar vein, the proposed data-driven, personalized course-taking plan recommends appropriate math courses for students at the opportune time by using large-scale educational data from current and past students??? performances. Additionally, the project incorporates algorithmic fairness constraints from computer science and statistics to ensure that the recommendations reduce existing disparities in course-taking patterns among racial/ethnic and income groups. More broadly, with the proposed, data-driven personalized recommendations, the project hopes to transform how students take math courses (or more broadly, K-12 STEM courses) so that every student, especially students from underrepresented or disadvantaged backgrounds, will opportunities to pursue STEM majors and careers. To develop personalized math course-taking plans, the project uses a set of statistical techniques known as optimal dynamic treatment regimes (OTRs). A crucial step in using OTRs is understanding treatment effect heterogeneity from the collected data. Consequently, the first aim of the project is to leverage the existing work on using machine learning to estimate heterogeneous effects of taking different math courses in large-scale educational studies. Next, the project uses Q-learning, A-learning, and value search methods to develop OTRs, specifically sequential decisions for math course-taking. Finally, to mitigate fairness-related harms in the proposed OTRs and to ensure that the OTRs do not produce discriminatory recommendations, the project utilizes fairness constraints from the algorithmic fairness literature. The project will translate the current state-of-the-art OTR methods into K- 12 math education policies and will constitute the first attempt to integrate algorithmic fairness and optimal policy learning to design equitable policies for STEM education. The project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research Building Capacity in STEM Education Research (ECR: BCSER) program, which is designed to build investigator's capacity to carry out high-quality STEM education research. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
A multi-level factors model affecting teachers' behavioral intention in AI-enabled education ecosystem;"Wu, Di; Zhang, Xinyan; Wang, Kaili; Wu, Longkai; Yang, Wei";2025;ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;Article;WoS;10.1007/s11423-024-10419-0;;;;Yes;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving ecological shifts and systemic reforms in education. As practitioners of educational reform, teachers' behavioral intention to experience and accept the effectiveness of AI technologies will affect the quality of educational change. From an educational ecology perspective, this study explores the impact of core elements within three dimensions-technologies, pedagogies, and cultures-on teachers' behavioral intention to use AI in an AI-enabled educational ecosystem (AI-e3) environment. The study uses a multi-level mediation model to analyze data of 4349 teachers from 189 primary and secondary schools from a western province of China. The results indicated that school-level dimensional elements, directly or indirectly, influenced teachers' behavioral intention to use AI, mediated by teacher-level dimensional elements. The findings are relevant to school administrators and policy makers, who should consider the key influences on teachers' behavioral intentions to use AI and promote the effective application of AI science for educational change.

Collaborative Research: Gamified Learning of Computing Hardware Fundamentals;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project aims to serve the national interest by designing a novel hands-on and gamified curriculum focusing on computing hardware fundamentals. Growing use of electronics in nearly all spheres of life has created a great need for engineers, scientists, and technicians to contribute to their sophisticated design and manufacturing process. However, misconceptions of hardware surrounding manufacturing jobs, along with the rising popularity of jobs in analytics and artificial intelligence, motivate students to avoid hardware-related college courses. Students??? knowledge of electronic hardware and basic principles of their operation have not received much attention. This has contributed to a remarkable skill gap in the current electronics industry. Hence, there is a critical need for training college students to learn the fundamentals of hardware from a system perspective through a hands-on approach. Additionally, there is a need to stimulate these students interests in hardware. The project aims to design engaging, collaborative, and thought-provoking gamified learning modules that will be played on an electronic hardware platform. Each gamified module, to be played individually or collaboratively in a team, will target training students on one major concept of hardware using an engaging and experimental learning approach. Games will introduce and exercise one of the fundamental concepts of computing hardware. Collectively, the gamified modules will provide a system-level perspective of the modern electronic system. The project intends to evaluate the curriculum at two universities and high schools. This collaborative project between University of Kansas and University of Florida will investigate a new paradigm of preparing undergraduate students with foundational concepts of electronic hardware and key principles of system operation, including underlying physics (e.g., signal propagation, switching of transistors) and mathematics (e.g., Boolean algebra, logic gates) of computing. The project seeks to understand the ability of gamified learning to stimulate situational interest and learning of hardware content among diverse groups of students, including women, low socio-economic status students, first-time-in-college students, and historically underrepresented ethnic minorities. This project has the potential to create a skilled and diversified workforce in the semiconductor industry. A mixed research method will be used to evaluate the proposed activities in this project. Project activities will also include development of similar gamified modules for high school students, which in turn leads to creating a recruiting pathway for more electrical and computer engineering undergraduate majors. The project will share the gamified modules, hardware platform design, course materials, and other outcomes with the educational and semiconductor community through web portals, workshops, tutorials, and special sessions. The project has potential to help students adopt emerging technologies with more complex functionality, such as augmented and virtual reality. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Higher Education Management and Student Achievement Assessment Method Based on Clustering Algorithm;Wang, Zhihui;2022;COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.1155/2022/4703975;;;;Yes;Monitoring and guiding instructional management require student performance evaluation. Traditional evaluation and analysis methods based on absolute scores, on the other hand, have certain flaws and are unable to fully reflect the information contained in student performance, thus limiting the impact of student performance evaluation on teaching and learning management. Data mining is regarded as the backbone technology for future information processing, and it introduces a new concept to the way humans use data. Schools must analyse and evaluate the performance of students in the same grade level and secondary school in a timely and staged manner. Clustering is a type of data mining that uses similarity rules to classify sample data into groups with a high degree of similarity. To address the difficulties caused by the wide variation in course difficulty in student performance evaluation, a method based on the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The K-means algorithm and the improved K-means algorithm with student information are investigated. The test results showed that the K-means clustering algorithm, the improved algorithm in this paper, and the fast global mean clustering algorithm all cluster the same randomly generated data set with noisy points, but the clustering time of the algorithm in this paper is only 0.04, which has obvious advantages. As a result, the clustering algorithm-based higher education management and student performance evaluation mechanism provides some insights for future research on student learning patterns. It is hoped that instructional administrators will gain a better understanding of students' learning characteristics so that they can better guide their teaching.
An Effective Decision-Making Support for Student Academic Path Selection using Machine Learning;"Houngue, Pelagie; Hountondji, Michel; Dagba, Theophile";2022;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;;;;Yes;Yes;In Benin, after the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), learners can either enroll in a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), or further their studies in the general education. Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6(th) to 9(th) grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners' ability and the stream. As a result, for learners' ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners' stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods. Furthermore, it provides a tool to ease students academic path selection, which may be used by educational institutes to ensure student performance. This paper presents the steps and the outputs of the study, we performed with some recommendations for future research.
Prisms, a novel immersive learning platform to increase proficiency on bottleneck topics in secondary STEM;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Project Summary/ AbstractPrisms of Reality seeks to develop and assess the impact and feasibility of an immersive virtual reality(IVR) learning platform that targets high-leverage pain points in the secondary math and sciencecurriculum to support a more diverse and well-equipped healthcare workforce. Our platform engagesstudents in self-directed scientific inquiry using compelling real world contexts that develop empiricaldecision-making skills with regards to key issues in public health. In Phase I, we will design an IVRlearning module for high school Algebra that emphasizes how mathematical modeling of ultraviolet raysusing trigonometric functions can be applied to reason quantitatively about the risks posed by ozonedepletion, which led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In the face of ever changing climate changeregulations, our module will ensure students are capable of flexibly applying quantitative models insupport of policies that advance public health outcomes while improving proficiency on math and scienceskills that preclude so many from continuing their education in STEM, specifically in the medical fields.There is evidence that IVR increases motivation and engagement, but applications in learning thatempirically improve student outcomes have proven to be elusive. Therefore, the development of apedagogical framework in IVR that leads to enduring understanding and increased achievement will beground-breaking for STEM teaching and learning. Our platform employs constructivist, gamifiednarratives that foster “hands on” student discovery and 3D sense-making of natural phenomena andmathematical models tied to public health issues. Through holistic data collection and analytics, ourteacher-facing learning management system will track each student’s conceptual progress and provideindividualized feedback. If successful, Prisms’ platform will not only transform the student experienceand achievement, but will provide a model of how progressive pedagogical practices can be actualizedthrough IVR to yield meaningful student outcomes.To develop the platform, in Phase I Prisms will a) design a robust game-based pedagogical frameworkthat harnesses innovative features unique to VR to cultivate deep conceptual flexibility and abstractreasoning skills based on authentic real world problems; b) explore effective VR functionalities,experience design, and development techniques for high quality implementation using the cost-effectiveOculus Quest; c) implement a teacher-facing learning management system that will provide teachersdata-driven insights about student learning in order to support individualized feedback and intervention;and d) evaluate productive user experience & empirically measure our platform’s impact on learningoutcomes in authentic classroom settings."

CAREER:Feedback-Controlled Microfluidic Chips with Integrated Sensor Networks for Blood Analysis;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Efficient exchange of metabolic signals with other tissues turns the blood into an opportunity to monitor and diagnose physiological and pathological conditions. Among the constituents of blood, white blood cells represent a particularly rich source of information due to their active involvement in the immune response of the body. As such, technologies that can rapidly characterize blood samples and extract reliable information are in ever-increasing demand for both clinical and basic research applications. The proposed work aims to develop smart microchips that can reliably analyze white blood cells from small blood samples without any sample preparation. These microchips will be low-cost, disposable, and will include built-in electrodes that can convert the chemical information from white blood cells into electrical signals to be interpreted by a smartphone and transmitted to the healthcare provider. The proposed research therefore has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling people to self-administer blood tests at home or in mobile settings. Besides his research, the PI is fully committed to the educational aspects of his profession and aspires to be a role model for next-generation engineers. The PI's educational goal is to create application-focused multidisciplinary courses, research opportunities and learning experiences for students. To this end, the PI proposes (1) to organize innovation tournaments to develop micro/nanotechnologies for solving biomedical challenges, (2) to implement a laboratory module in the graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, (3) to involve and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in conducting the research activities of this proposal, (4) to mentor high school teachers to attract K-12 and High School Students and underrepresented groups to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Despite being highly effective in manipulating cells, microfluidic devices lack native sensing schemes and hence often act as upstream sample preparation elements before quantitative measurements typically performed with a laboratory instrument. The disconnect between microfluidic manipulation and quantitative measurements is an important limitation that hampers the widespread adoption of these tools outside of academic research laboratories, for example in resource-limited or in point-of-care settings, where they can be truly transformative in healthcare delivery. The PI's career goal is to develop polymer-based lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms with built-in sensor networks, whose purposely simple hardware will be augmented by complex computational algorithms, to function as content-aware, autonomous microfluidic devices for quantitative cell analysis. To achieve this goal, the PI will adopt a highly multidisciplinary approach combining traditionally-distant disciplines such as microsystem engineering, information theory, data science, and biomedicine. This proposal will (1) design and fabricate plastic microfluidic chips wired with networks of interconnected electrical micro-sensors, each individually designed to produce a signature response that can be recognized among others through computation, (2) develop computational algorithms to process compressed data from the sensor network by utilizing both model-based signal processing and machine learning approaches, (3) develop open- and closed-loop controlled microfluidic systems, where a host of actuators are combined with spatiotemporal data generated by networked sensors to extract biological information from the sample under test, (4) combine all of the developed concepts to create an autonomous and adaptive microfluidic system that can analyze whole blood samples by label-free immunophenotyping of white blood cells.

Challenging Cognitive Load Theory: The Role of Educational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence in Redefining Learning Efficacy;"Gkintoni, Evgenia; Antonopoulou, Hera; Sortwell, Andrew; Halkiopoulos, Constantinos";2025;BRAIN SCIENCES;Review;WoS;10.3390/brainsci15020203;;;;Yes;Background/Objectives: This systematic review integrates Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), Educational Neuroscience (EdNeuro), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to examine their combined impact on optimizing learning environments. It explores how AI-driven adaptive learning systems, informed by neurophysiological insights, enhance personalized education for K-12 students and adult learners. This study emphasizes the role of Electroencephalography (EEG), Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and other neurophysiological tools in assessing cognitive states and guiding AI-powered interventions to refine instructional strategies dynamically. Methods: This study reviews n = 103 papers related to the integration of principles of CLT with AI and ML in educational settings. It evaluates the progress made in neuroadaptive learning technologies, especially the real-time management of cognitive load, personalized feedback systems, and the multimodal applications of AI. Besides that, this research examines key hurdles such as data privacy, ethical concerns, algorithmic bias, and scalability issues while pinpointing best practices for robust and effective implementation. Results: The results show that AI and ML significantly improve Learning Efficacy due to managing cognitive load automatically, providing personalized instruction, and adapting learning pathways dynamically based on real-time neurophysiological data. Deep Learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) improve classification accuracy, making AI-powered adaptive learning systems more efficient and scalable. Multimodal approaches enhance system robustness by mitigating signal variability and noise-related limitations by combining EEG with fMRI, Electrocardiography (ECG), and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). Despite these advances, practical implementation challenges remain, including ethical considerations, data security risks, and accessibility disparities across learner demographics. Conclusions: AI and ML are epitomes of redefinition potentials that solid ethical frameworks, inclusive design, and scalable methodologies must inform. Future studies will be necessary for refining pre-processing techniques, expanding the variety of datasets, and advancing multimodal neuroadaptive learning for developing high-accuracy, affordable, and ethically responsible AI-driven educational systems. The future of AI-enhanced education should be inclusive, equitable, and effective across various learning populations that would surmount technological limitations and ethical dilemmas.
Building a Sense of Belonging for Talented, Low-Income Students through Engagement;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Dakota State University (DSU). Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to twelve unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor???s degrees in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Cyber Operations, or Mathematics. DSU is the technology campus in the South Dakota Board of Regents State University system and holds three prestigious designations from the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security relating to the project's focal disciplines. Students will receive scholarships of up to $15,000 per year for up to five years, depending on their financial need. A summer bridge program, study tables, and an undergraduate research seminar are the key planned activities of this project. One out of every five students currently enrolled in the eligible scholarship majors at DSU are Pell Grant eligible, which provides a substantial population of potential scholars and demonstrates the project's potential to broaden participation in STEM fields at DSU and in the wider workforce. The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project will help address the national need for qualified professionals educated in highly technical fields including advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and network security (cyber operations). Each of these areas are in extremely high demand and are critical priorities for national security and other critical sectors of the domestic workforce. This project will collect data to explore what scholars need from support mechanisms and how they want that support delivered. This will allow the creation of a support network that better aligns with students' needs and preferences. It is expected that aligning support mechanisms with scholars needs will result in increased participation, which will in turn improve graduation rates and overall student outcomes. Recruitment efforts include engaging with Native American high school students participating in the Oglala Lakota College Summer IT Institute, veterans with National Cryptographic University credits, and rural South Dakota high school students with credits from the Governor???s Cyber Academy.

Collaborative Research: Gamified Learning of Computing Hardware Fundamentals;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project aims to serve the national interest by designing a novel hands-on and gamified curriculum focusing on computing hardware fundamentals. Growing use of electronics in nearly all spheres of life has created a great need for engineers, scientists, and technicians to contribute to their sophisticated design and manufacturing process. However, misconceptions of hardware surrounding manufacturing jobs, along with the rising popularity of jobs in analytics and artificial intelligence, motivate students to avoid hardware-related college courses. Students??? knowledge of electronic hardware and basic principles of their operation have not received much attention. This has contributed to a remarkable skill gap in the current electronics industry. Hence, there is a critical need for training college students to learn the fundamentals of hardware from a system perspective through a hands-on approach. Additionally, there is a need to stimulate these students interests in hardware. The project aims to design engaging, collaborative, and thought-provoking gamified learning modules that will be played on an electronic hardware platform. Each gamified module, to be played individually or collaboratively in a team, will target training students on one major concept of hardware using an engaging and experimental learning approach. Games will introduce and exercise one of the fundamental concepts of computing hardware. Collectively, the gamified modules will provide a system-level perspective of the modern electronic system. The project intends to evaluate the curriculum at two universities and high schools. This collaborative project between University of Kansas and University of Florida will investigate a new paradigm of preparing undergraduate students with foundational concepts of electronic hardware and key principles of system operation, including underlying physics (e.g., signal propagation, switching of transistors) and mathematics (e.g., Boolean algebra, logic gates) of computing. The project seeks to understand the ability of gamified learning to stimulate situational interest and learning of hardware content among diverse groups of students, including women, low socio-economic status students, first-time-in-college students, and historically underrepresented ethnic minorities. This project has the potential to create a skilled and diversified workforce in the semiconductor industry. A mixed research method will be used to evaluate the proposed activities in this project. Project activities will also include development of similar gamified modules for high school students, which in turn leads to creating a recruiting pathway for more electrical and computer engineering undergraduate majors. The project will share the gamified modules, hardware platform design, course materials, and other outcomes with the educational and semiconductor community through web portals, workshops, tutorials, and special sessions. The project has potential to help students adopt emerging technologies with more complex functionality, such as augmented and virtual reality. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Evaluating Effects of Automatic Feedback Aligned to a Learning Progression to Promote Knowledge-In-Use;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This project examines the effect of an assessment system that automatically generates feedback based on students??? open-ended assessment responses in chemistry and physics consistent with a previously-developed learning progression that describes the successively more complex understandings students can develop about electrical interactions. The researchers will design and test an automated assessment scoring system using machine learning. The scoring system will provide individualized feedback to students and class summaries to their teachers. This could then serve as a formative assessment to match an existing high school physical science curriculum designed to meet performance expectations in the Next Generation Science Standards. The project will then examine whether the automatic feedback supports students??? learning outcomes and their development with respect to the learning progression on electrical interactions. The project promotes students??? knowledge of science by engaging them in scientific practices, like modeling, with key disciplinary ideas and using crosscutting concepts to make sense of compelling phenomena and by providing real-time feedback to students. Deepening students??? knowledge of science requires that they have opportunities to solve ill-structured, complex problems and to create models of real-world phenomena. This project serves the national interest by examining how to assess and support students in responding to such problems in science through timely and productive feedback about their performances. The project has two research questions: 1) What is the effect of automatic feedback on student performance along a previously validated learning progression for physical science aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards? 2) What is the effect of automatic feedback on how students connect ideas to advance in learning progression levels? To address these questions the project uses a curriculum aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards and a validated learning progression for student learning about how electrical interactions allow materials to stick together or be repelled. The project has an automatic scoring tool that applies natural language processing, image recognition, and supervised machine learning to score students??? explanations and modeling responses. The project embeds the scoring tool in a newly designed and developed web-portal to allow the integration of curriculum materials, assessments, and automatic scoring with real-time feedback. Students respond to formative assessment items embedded in the curriculum; a subset of these are automatically scored by machine learning algorithms. Students receive automatic feedback on their responses based on the computer classification of their responses. Student learning, as defined by advancement on learning progression levels, is measured using item response theory on student performance on the summative assessments given at the start and end of the curriculum units. The project also uses network and cluster analyses for student responses to formative items to identify ways that students respond to feedback and advance along the learning progression. Outcomes from this project will provide guidance on how to provide appropriate feedback to students on science performance assessment items and a machine learning based tool for scoring model representations and explanations. The project will refine an online curriculum for high school physical science composed of learning materials, activities and assessment items, and produce an associated automatic scoring process and individualized feedback. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.???

Student Performance Predictor using Multiclass Support Vector Classification Algorithm;"Athani, Suhas S.; Kodli, Sharath A.; Banavasi, Mayur N.; Hiremath, P. G. Sunitha";2017;PROCEEDINGS OF 2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION (ICSPC'17);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;Educational data mining provides the process of applying different data mining tools and techniques to analyze and visualize the data of an institution and can be used to discover a unique pattern of students' academic performance. Secondary schools are increasing rapidly from past years and progress of the institution can be measured based on student's success and failure rates. Failure rates can be measured in terms of a core subject such as mathematics which has been considered in this proposed system. Real data was collected using school Reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used for the project. The students will be classified according to the grades assigned for the range of marks scored by them. This involves classifying the students into five levels of grading system starting from grade 'A' to grade 'F' where grade 'A' represents the student getting the highest marks, grade 'B' being the second highest, grade 'C' being third, grade 'D' being the fourth and the grade 'F' which implies that the student has failed. To carry out this type of classification many machine learning algorithms can be used to implement it. Comparison was made between the algorithms like Multiclass Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks using the Weka tool. Based on the analysis carried out Multiclass Support Vector Machine showed prominent accuracy. The Multiclass Support Vector Machine is implemented on the basis of one-to-rest strategy use of class labels which is primarily an extension of linear Support Vector Machine. In order to get appropriate results in terms of the accuracy of the model, parameters like 'C' and 'Gamma' is tuned while implementing Multiclass Support Vector Machine. The result gives a good predictive accuracy based on the grades that are provided by the school. The accuracy of prediction made by Support Vector Machine Classifier is determined by using K fold cross validation, according to which the accuracy is 89%.

Using interpretable machine learning approaches to predict and provide explanations for student completion of remedial mathematics;Mgonja, Thomas;2024;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-024-12647-6;;;;Yes;The successful completion of remedial mathematics is widely recognized as a crucial factor for college success. However, there is considerable concern and ongoing debate surrounding the low completion rates observed in remedial mathematics courses across various parts of the world. This study applies explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools to interpret predictions on whether students will complete mathematics remediation. Various machine learning models are compared, with random forest emerging as superior in predicting non-completion. Global interpretations using correlation analysis, logistic regression, feature importance, permutation importance, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) summary plots identify significant predictors such as college grade point average (G.P.A), high school G.P.A, starting point in the remedial sequence, number of failed remedial courses, delay in remediation, Rate My Professor scores, and age. Additionally, local interpretations using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE) analyses were utilized to garner tailored advise for at-risk students. It was observed that instructor attributes cannot be overlooked, especially, when exploring local interpretations. Future research should consider other features such as a students' socio-economic status (SES), employment status, and placement exam scores. Future studies could also involve data from multiple institutions and examine user experience in implementing these models.

CAREER: Fine-Grained Complexity and Algorithms for Structured Linear Equations and Linear Programs;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Abstract: Linear equations and linear programs are ubiquitous in computational mathematics, engineering, machine learning, and data science, and they are powerful primitives for developing various algorithmic paradigms. Unfortunately, the currently best-known algorithms for solving general linear equations and linear programs run in super-quadratic time, which can be prohibitively slow for modern large-scale datasets. In practice, however, many linear equations and programs exhibit additional structures that enable significantly faster solvers. This project aims (1) to identify and classify structures that can accelerate solving linear equations and linear programs and those that can not and (2) to understand how fast we can solve general linear equations and linear programs. Another major part of this project is to provide multi-disciplinary education and research training for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students and to broaden the participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM fields. This project aims to study fine-grained complexity and algorithms for structured linear equations and structured linear programs and focuses on three major goals. The first goal is to establish ``equivalent`` classes for structured linear equations and linear programs so that if we can solve one problem fast, we can immediately solve all the problems in the same equivalence class equally fast. The second goal is to develop efficient solvers for structured linear equations and linear programs that arise commonly from practice. Examples include generalized Laplacians with additional geometric structures, dense instances such as kernel matrices, and random instances. Finally, the third goal is to better understand the time complexity of general linear equations and linear programs. For example, can we solve general linear equations and linear programs faster than matrix multiplication? What are the runtime lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time HypoThesis? This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
An Approach to Oral English Assessment Based on Intelligent Computing Model;"Jing, Caihong; Zhao, Xiaoling; Ren, Haiyan; Chen, Xuexia; Gaowa, Naren";2022;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;Article;WoS;10.1155/2022/4663574;;;Yes;Yes;English craze has become a key topic of concern to the majority of the people. Apart from setting English as a compulsory course like Chinese and Mathematics in schools, various English training institutions outside the school are also emerging one after another. Due to the English teaching mode in class, dumb English appears. In recent years, with the popularity of virtual electronic devices, more and more researchers try to use virtual reality (VR) to create an immersive English learning environment. Oral English teaching is an important part of the whole English teaching. In the traditional English classroom teaching practice, teachers' pronunciation is not standard, and students are difficult to learn the correct pronunciation standard, which makes oral English very passive. The most important problem in oral English teaching is to improve students' interest in oral English, make students willing to speak and realize English communication. Oral English teaching is an important link in both primary and secondary schools and universities. Teachers are afraid of nonstandard pronunciation in limited classrooms, and they are afraid to speak and unwilling to speak, which leads to passive oral English teaching. Therefore, this paper will set up an intelligent computing model to evaluate and analyze spoken English in a standard and accurate way. Artificial intelligence speech synThesis and imitation of voice change are typical applications of decoupling representation learning in speech, the oral evaluation is based on the proposition that speech is a dynamic and complex process. With the help of the rapidly developed computer speech synThesis and imitation technology, an oral evaluation path based on speech synThesis and imitation is proposed, that is, oral evaluation is carried out by using the network parameters and output of deep learning of computer speech imitation.
CAREER: Investigating Nanosheets of Thermosensitive Polymer Grafted Nanoparticles: Integrated Research and Education;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports computational and theoretical research, and education aimed to advance understanding of nanomaterials and how they self-assemble. Different nanomaterials with various structures, properties, and functions have been developed by employing self-assembly approaches that spontaneously organize atoms or molecules into ordered structures. A new class of emerging nanomaterials are sheets made of highly ordered metallic nanoparticle arrays separated by attached organic molecular chains. Spacing between these nanoparticles largely determines their functional properties such as optical, catalytic, and electronic. Mechanical properties such as strength and flexibility often determine whether a nanosheet can be used in an application, such as an optoelectronic or biomedical device. Currently, the ability to design 2D nanosheets with desired spacing between nanoparticles and mechanical properties remains an open challenge. The PI aims to use simulation to develop design rules for controlling the spacing between the nanoparticles, and the mechanical properties of 2D nanosheets. The insights obtained from this research are aimed to help guide experimental efforts to engineer 2D nanosheets that possess desired functional and mechanical properties. This project includes an integrated education and outreach plan that leverages results and software tools generated in the course of the research. The plan is intended to improve student training and enhance diversity. The educational activities will focus on integrating machine learning methods and data science concepts into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. In addition, an online three-week course will be developed; it will focus on applications of artificial intelligence in science and engineering for working professionals from industry as the target audience. The research team will develop virtual reality software, which will be used to stimulate the interest of middle- and high-school students in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports computational and theoretical research, and education on two-dimensional (2D) monolayered nanosheets of functionalized nanoparticles, which are composed of highly ordered, hexagonally packed inorganic nanoparticle arrays separated by grafted organic ligands. These nanosheets have emerged as a fundamentally new class of nanomaterials. The nanoparticle packing and mechanical properties of these nanosheets are important in determining their suitability for applications ranging from optoelectronics to biomedical fields. Packing controls functionality, for example optical, and catalytic properties of the nanosheets. However, due to a lack of a direct molecular-level characterization technique to study the structure of these nanosheets and lack of availability of accurate computational models, our ability to design 2D nanosheets with required nanoparticle packing and mechanical properties is limited. The PI aims to establish a fundamental molecular-level understanding of the nanoparticle packing and mechanical properties of 2D nanosheets of thermosensitive polymer functionalized nanoparticles using multi-scale simulation models. A machine learning accelerated optimization framework will be used to develop transferable and compatible coarse-grained models of thermosensitive polymers, metals, and solvents. These models will be employed to perform hypoThesis-driven calculations aimed to address fundamental questions about the effect of polymer characteristics, nanoparticle design parameters, and metal type on the nanoparticle packing and mechanical properties of the nanosheets obtained through self-assembly of polymer grafted nanoparticles. The successful completion of this research would establish design rules for multifunctional nanosheets with desired nanoparticle packing and mechanical properties. The integrated education plan is directly tied to these research activities. The PI intends to incorporate artificial intelligence into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum by introducing machine learning methods to engineering students. The PI will develop an online three-week course with focus on applications of artificial intelligence in science and engineering for working professionals from industry as the target audience. As a part of integrated outreach activities, the research team will develop a 4-D Nanosimulator, which creates an interactive virtual reality environment that can be used to enter the world of atoms through simulation trajectories. This software will be used to engage middle- and high-school students and stimulate their interest in pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
A Machine Learning Framework for Acceleration of Materials Prediction;;2014;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY Computational research has been playing an increasingly important role in the development of new materials. The central aim of this project is to create a theoretical framework and computational tools capable of speeding up the prediction of new synthesizable materials by orders of magnitude. The efficiency and the reliability of the method will be achieved by combining two bio-inspired algorithms. A learning neural network scheme will be implemented in the Module for Ab Initio Structure Evolution package which presently has the capability to perform global structure optimization with an evolutionary algorithm. The introduced computational approach will be applicable to a broad range of material classes and expected to accelerate the exploration of complex systems. A particular focus will be placed on the development of metal oxide catalysts and metal-based battery electrodes for energy-related applications. Artificial neural networks are a powerful tool used in many research areas for dealing with classification, control, and interpolation problems in multi-dimensional spaces. The application of the method to solid state problems requires a formalism specifically designed for building and training neural networks to map the potential energy profiles of given atomic configurations. Namely, an automated algorithm should be able to parse an arbitrary atomic configuration into a suitable set of input parameters, train the neural network on a relevant dataset, and monitor the ability to produce accurate total energy and atomic forces during simulations. The PI's preliminary work and the recent research in the field have shown that, compared to widely used quantum mechanical and classical models, neural networks have the potential to provide a good balance between accuracy and efficiency. The project will include multiple educational activities to foster high-school and undergraduate students' interest in science and mathematics. Students will have the opportunity to learn about computational methods and take part in the research under PI's supervision. A part of the outreach work will be done through Binghamton University's Evolutionary Studies program which brings together students and researchers from biological, physics, and computer sciences. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This award supports computational and theoretical research and education directed at advancing analytical and computational techniques for materials discovery. Computational input can be particularly valuable at the initial stages of materials development providing libraries of synthesizable candidates and possible synThesis conditions. The success of determining new stable materials depends on the careful global optimization of crystal structures and the accurate evaluation of their thermodynamic stability. Traditionally, the two challenges have been addressed separately. This project will combine a neural network method with an evolutionary algorithm to automate and accelerate compound prediction. The neural network formalism will be generalized to describe a wide range of interatomic interactions with near ab initio accuracy while scaling linearly with the system size. Preliminary tests have shown the ability of such models to capture subtle many-body effects. The developed computational approach is expected to accelerate the exploration of systems known to exhibit particularly complex structures, such as metal oxide catalysts or metal-based battery electrodes. Neural network models will be trained, in particular, on already generated databases containing thousands of entries. Analysis of the constructed neutral-network-based interpolators will advance the fundamental understanding of the bonding mechanisms for future rational materials design. The compound prediction tool offering a combination of two bio-inspired algorithms will be released as an open-source code. One of the objectives is to create a shared online resource with full access to all built interatomic models and all ab initio data used for training the neural networks. Such a platform will ensure reuse of generated density functional theory data and reduce the redundancy of expensive ab initio calculations. Validation of the developed predictive approach will be carried out in close collaborations with Chemistry and Engineering experimental groups at Binghamton University. The project will also include multiple educational activities to foster high-school and undergraduate students' interest in science and mathematics. Students will have the opportunity to learn about computational methods and take part in the research under PI's supervision. A part of the outreach work will be done through Binghamton University's Evolutionary Studies program which brings together students and researchers from biological, physics, and computer sciences.
Diagnosing misconceptions about algebra using Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning;;2014;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project, to be conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and Carleton College, will develop an online math tutor to help high school and college students learn algebra. The tutor will diagnose students' misconceptions about algebra by asking them to solve a series of math problems. The website will be made available to students anywhere, making it possible to collect large amounts of data on algebra problem solving that will be used to refine the technological approach, develop computational models of student learning, optimize the design of tests, and identify effective strategies for online learning and teaching. This project will advance the work of the REAL (Research on Education and Learning) program in studying the cognitive basis of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) learning, as well as the Cyberlearning program in discovering how to design and effectively use learning technologies of the future. The approach used for knowledge diagnosis in the online tutor will be Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning. This approach combines ideas from machine learning and cognitive science. Students' responses will be modeled using Markov decision processes, a decision-theoretic formalism that indicates how a rational agent should take a series of actions to achieve a goal. This will make it possible to calculate the probability that a student would take a particular series of actions, given his or her knowledge of the domain. Bayesian inference will be used to invert this model, providing a probability distribution over the knowledge state of the student given his or her actions. Applying this approach to algebra problem solving will make it possible to identify students' misconceptions from freeform solutions to algebra problems. The proposed research will require addressing challenges such as working with the infinite, structured state spaces that are needed to describe algebraic equations, accommodating composite actions (such as skipping a step in a derivation), modeling learning, and optimizing the design of assessments.
CAREER: Advancing Shape Learning for Biosciences;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Understanding the healthy and pathological shapes of biological structures (proteins, cells, organs) directly from image data is critical to understand their roles in living organisms. The impact for human health and society range from our understanding of cancers to the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. This CAREER proposal will evaluate and develop reliable shape analysis methods that can harness the recent bio-imaging data explosion, advance our understanding of the fundamental rules of life, and enable breakthroughs in data-driven biomedicine. Tightly integrated with the research activities, the education and outreach objective is to engage diverse audiences in shape analysis and bioscience through novel art-science performances for high-school students, pioneering courses on geometric machine learning for shape analysis, training of graduate students, and free community outreach lectures for the wide audience. Despite impressive advances in the field of shape analysis, its deployment to biosciences is prohibited by computational and statistical hurdles. This yields challenges related to the interpretation of results, where inconsistent analyses bear the danger of driving scientific conclusions in the wrong direction ???a serious drawback for a discipline that ultimately researches human health. In mathematics, (biological) shapes can be represented as shapes of key points, shapes of curves, or shapes of surfaces. The associated shape data spaces present common abstract geometric structures of non-Euclidean manifolds. This project will utilize these commonalities to establish a consistent numerical framework to systematically and exhaustively evaluate the possible inconsistencies of machine learning algorithms on shape spaces. In particular, it will provide a deep dive into the geodesic and polynomial regression models on non-Euclidean manifolds. The findings will be leveraged into a pilot study that will reliably extract biologically relevant parameters on the morphodynamics of cells migrating in vivo. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

CAREER: Geometry-inspired approaches to information theory and learning;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Information theory and geometry are closely intertwined; theoretical developments in one domain have stimulated significant breakthroughs in the other. In geometry, a large body of literature is devoted to studying the sizes and shapes of low-dimensional projections of geometric objects. However, few parallels exist in information theory. On the other hand, information theory has a rich set of tools to analyze extremal problems, which have no suitable analogs in geometry. This project aims to combine the individual strengths of both areas to expand the set of mathematical tools that can be brought to bear upon the study of geometry and information theory. An important goal of the project is the practical applications of results and insights gained through such a study. Motivated by applications in modern data analysis, such as random projections, tomographic reconstruction, and neural network-based algorithms, this project will explore geometry-inspired approaches in modern machine learning. The planned research is highly interdisciplinary and serves to bring together different communities in engineering, mathematics, and computer science. The project will contribute to the intellectual development of undergraduate and graduate students through teaching and research mentorship. Besides, the investigator will engage regularly with K-12 students via the Wisconsin Math, Science, and Engineering Talent Search, and deliver talks at local middle and high schools on topics related to geometry and information theory. The project consists of three distinct technical thrusts. In the first thrust, novel notions of entropy will be developed to characterize the randomness of lower-dimensional projections of a random variable, addressing a conspicuous gap in the geometrization of probability literature. In the second thrust, a new framework for solving extremal problems in geometry using information inequalities will be developed. Novel information inequalities will be investigated and applied to tomographic reconstruction and analysis of X-Ray and Radon transforms. Finally, the third thrust will consider new directions in the theory and applications of machine learning by using tools derived from geometry, information theory, and optimal transport. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

I/UCRC: Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML);;2016;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The semiconductor industry is perennially one of America's top exporters. Worldwide semiconductor sales for 2014 reached $335.8 billion, and the number of U.S. jobs in this sector was estimated to be around 250,000 in 2013. More broadly, the U.S. tech industry, which depends on semiconductor innovation to spur new products and applications, is itself estimated to represent no less than 5.7% of the entire U.S. private sector workforce (at nearly 6.5 million jobs), and with a tech industry payroll of $654 billion in 2014, it accounted for over 11% of all U.S. private sector payroll. Yet despite its success, the industry must continue to innovate if the U.S. is to retain global leadership in this highly competitive area. The complexity of modern microelectronic products necessitates the use of computer tools to formulate and verify product designs prior to manufacturing. When a product doesn't operate as intended or suffers early failures, this can often be attributed to inadequacy of the models used during the design process. In fact, the shortcomings of existing approaches for system component modeling have become a serious impediment to continued innovation. The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) proposes to create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. Success will make it much easier and cheaper to optimize a system design, allowing the industry to produce lower-power and lower-cost electronic systems without sacrificing functionality. The eventual result will be significant growth in capabilities that will drive innovation throughout the electronics industry, leading to new devices and applications, continued entrepreneurial leadership, and economic growth. While achieving those goals, CAEML will also focus on diversifying the undergraduate engineering student body and improving the undergraduate experience. Students from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering will be targeted for recruitment as undergraduate research assistants. Member companies will provide internships and mentors for participating students, and the diverse graduate and undergraduate student researchers in CAEML will receive hands-on multidisciplinary education. CAEML will also participate in all three site universities' existing avenues for student and faculty engagement with local youth. In particular, university-based summer camps are a tried and tested method of making high-school students familiar with and comfortable on our campuses. The Girls' Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (GAMES) summer camp program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Illinois) brings high-school girls to campus for a week of hands-on engineering activities and camaraderie. The engineering content for many of the GAMES camps, including the one on electrical engineering, is developed by engineering faculty. CAEML undergraduate and graduate students can serve as counselors or instructors for camps; the CAEML team proposes to develop new activities and workshops for high-school campers on all three sites' campuses. In addition, the Beginning Teacher STEM Conference at Illinois brings 150 teachers who have just completed their first year in the classroom to the Urbana-Champaign campus for 2 days to deepen their knowledge of STEM fields and try out activities for use in their classrooms; several of the sessions are taught by College of Engineering faculty including those affiliated with CAEML. The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) will create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation, with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. The electronics industry's continued ability to innovate requires the creation of optimization methodologies that result in low-power integrated systems that meet performance specifications, despite being composed of components whose characteristics exhibit variability and that operate in different physical or signal domains. Today, shortcomings in accuracy and comprehensiveness of component-level behavioral models impede the advancement of computer-aided electronic system design optimization. The model accuracy also impacts system verification. Ultimately, the proper functionality of an electronic system is verified through testing of a representative sample. However, modern electronic systems are so complex that it is unthinkable to bring one to the manufacturing stage without first verifying its operation using simulation. Today, simulation generally does not ensure that an integrated circuit or electronic system will pass qualification testing the first time, and failures are often attributed to insufficiency of the simulation models. With an improved modeling capability, one could achieve better design efficiency, and also perform design optimization. For system simulation, behavioral models of the components' terminal responses are desired for both computational tractability and protection of intellectual property. Despite many years of significant effort by the electronic design automation community, there is not a general, systematic method to generate accurate and comprehensive behavioral models, in part because of the nonlinear, complex, and multi-port nature of the components being modeled. CAEML will pioneer the use of machine-learning methods to extract behavioral models of electronic components and subsystems from simulation waveforms and/or measurement data. The Center will make 2 primary contributions to the field of machine learning: it will demonstrate the application of machine learning to electronics modeling, and develop the entire machine-learning pipeline. Historically, machine-learning theorists have focused on the model learning and evaluation tasks, but CAEML will focus on end-to-end performance of the pipeline, including data acquisition, selection and filtering, as well as cost function specification. CAEML will develop a methodology to use prior knowledge, i.e., physical constraints and the domain knowledge provided by designers, to speed up the learning process. Novel methods of incorporating component variability, including that due to semiconductor process variations, will be developed. The intended end-users are electronic design automation (EDA) tool developers, IC design houses, and system design and manufacturing companies. CAEML consists of 3 sites: Illinois, Georgia Tech, and NC State. The scope of research at each site encompasses both algorithm development and the application of the derived models to a variety of IC and system design tasks. Investigators at all 3 university sites have unique skills and expertise while sharing interests in electronic design automation, IC design, system-level signal integrity, and power distribution. To leverage the cross-campus expertise, many of the Center's proposed projects involve investigators from more than one site. The Illinois investigators have special expertise in computational electromagnetics, electrostatic discharge (ESD), and optimization; they bring capabilities in areas such as circuit design for ESD-induced error detection, computationally-efficient stochastic electromagnetic field simulation, reduced-order modeling and behavioral modeling of electrical/electromagnetic circuits and systems, and multi-domain physics modeling in the presence of uncertainty and variability. All three sites have strong research records in the fields of signal integrity analysis and electronic design automation. Excellent computational resources are available at Illinois for the proposed work; the necessary test and measurement equipment is also available, including a system-level ESD test-bed."

CAREER: Gaussian Processes for Scientific Machine Learning: Theoretical Analysis and Computational Algorithms;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly changing our lives at every scale, from our personal day-to-day activities to large scale shifts in our society, economy, and geopolitics. These technologies have also profoundly transformed sciences with new ideas and algorithms being developed at an immense speed. However, our mathematical understanding of these algorithms is still far beyond their practical development and widespread adoption. Put simply, in many cases we do not know how or why machine learning algorithms work so well, which in turn limits our ability to safely deploy them in safety critical engineering and scientific scenarios. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical formalism and understanding of problems at the intersection of machine learning and science (i.e., scientific machine learning) using rigorous mathematics, leading to novel algorithms and computational methodologies that are interpretable, supported by rigorous theory, and aware of uncertainties. The project is focused on the development of novel Gaussian Process (GP) based computational frameworks for scientific machine learning that are provably well-posed, robust, and stable, thereby meeting the high standards of scientific computing. The developed methodologies will be capable of rigorous uncertainty quantification and inherit the desirable properties of machine learning algorithms such as flexibility, generalizability, and applicability in high-dimensions. The efforts of the project are directed in three primary directions: (1) GPs for solving nonlinear, high-dimensional and parametric PDEs; (2) GPs for operator learning, emulation, and physics discovery; and (3) GPs for high-dimensional sampling, inference, and generative modeling. Each research direction focuses on the development of algorithms, foundational theory, and concrete applications in engineering and science. The project also contains an extensive education plan focused on machine learning and data science education from high-school through graduate levels with extensive opportunities for training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as local and international outreach.

RTG: Research Training in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This Research Training Group (RTG) project is a joint effort of the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, the Department of Mathematics, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Columbia University. It aims to create a cutting-edge research and training program in modern applied mathematics. By substantially enriching research and educational experiences for trainees, and by directly coupling into key educational and research initiatives in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and across the University, the activities will have a significant impact on applied mathematics education and training at Columbia. The RTG project will engage high school as well as undergraduate students from the New York metropolitan area and across the country (through the Summer Research Program), inspiring mathematical careers for underrepresented groups in the United States. The project includes three main ingredients: (i) a group of research topics in applied mathematics at the frontier of engineering applications; (ii) a coherent mentoring-learning program on applied mathematics research and career development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars; and (iii) a systematic plan to modernize undergraduate and graduate curriculum in applied mathematics and scientific computation. The senior investigators and the trainees will form groups to tackle challenging and rewarding mathematical and computational problems, including linear and nonlinear wave propagation in novel complex (and possibly random) structures, physics- and data-enabled algorithms for material discovery, hybrid inverse problems and imaging, mathematical theory of machine learning, harmonic analysis of large data sets, and uncertainty quantification. They will collaborate with leading engineers at Columbia to connect their mathematical and computational discoveries with applications in nonlinear optics and photonics, materials science, medical imaging, climate modeling, and general data science. The senior members of this RTG project are strongly committed to training and mentoring undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars.

Targeted Infusion Project: Advancing Basic Science Research and Undergraduate Education in Computer Vision;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Undergraduate Program???s Targeted Infusion Projects aim to support research and educational projects to improve the success of HBCU students in science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and careers. Computer vision is an important subfield of artificial intelligence, and it deals with developing and analyzing algorithms that can extract useful information from images. Its origins can be traced to research activities in the 1960s aiming to invent machines that imitate human cognitive functions in directly observing information from photos. Since computer vision is instrumental in science and technology, this targeted infusion project focuses on advancing this field by improving curriculum and establishing new educational and research infrastructures at Texas Southern University. Learning computer vision theories can be challenging for most undergraduate students as these theories often involve high levels of mathematical relations. A common way of teaching computer vision is to present theoretical foundations that are followed by examples to highlight the significance of these theories. However, students may have difficulties following lengthy mathematical derivations and understanding specific rationales of these derivations without seeing examples that clarify the role of major components. In order to improve teaching methodology in computer vision, this project aims to implement and investigate two teaching models, based on theoretical and hands-on exposure to computer vision. The other aims of this project are to create a computer vision certification program including a new course on this field at Texas Southern University, to create a computer vision research program to engage senior year undergraduate students in research, and to provide educational and research opportunities to high school students in computer vision through summer boot camps. To this end, learning modules with theoretical and laboratory components to strengthen students' knowledge and practical skills, computational resources, and continuous supervision for their research projects are provided. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Educational programs integrate research and education across levels from precollege through postdoctoral via activities including an extensive Research Experiences for Undergraduates program; a Reconnect program run at satellite locations around the country for 2-year and 4-year college faculty highlighting recent research topics relevant to the classroom; a year-round program of workshops for middle and high school teachers; and development of classroom materials in areas including bio-mathematics, computational thinking, and planning for sustainability. Connections with researchers in education enhance understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play when students master computational thinking skills, allowing creation of research-informed materials that facilitate teaching and enhance learning. Several DIMACS programs use multi-layer mentoring models for providing mentoring to students while instilling in them the capacity to mentor, both enhancing their own skills and serving to build excitement for computing and computing-related careers in the next generation."

Collaborative Research: Cyberinfrastructure for Robust Learning of Interconnected Knowledge;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Improving student success in subject domains that serve as gateway courses to STEM careers, such as chemistry and math, is of great interest. These subjects are difficult to teach and learn, partly because they involve a complex network of interconnected knowledge. Current online instructional materials generally follow a linear sequence, tracing a single predetermined pathway through the knowledge network. The CyberBook technology developed in this project instead guides students through the knowledge network along pathways chosen to optimize their learning of both the individual concepts and the relations between these concepts. The pathways adapt to individual students, with information gathered from a student???s interaction with the online materials to select a pathway that is optimal for that individual student. Although the primary focus is on chemistry and mathematics, the approach can be applied to other STEM domains. CyberBook combines traditional online courseware with intelligent tutoring systems. It also provides a research platform for learning scientists to conduct studies on how students learn. Beyond learning science, the proposed research has the potential to advance the literature on education (both domain-specific and domain-general), educational data mining, and artificial intelligence in education. This project will develop several advanced learning-engineering methods to facilitate the creation of high-quality and effective online courseware: (1) an application of reinforcement learning to compute optimal sequencing of topics and scaffolding, (2) a text-mining method to automatically discover skills to be learned from text in written instructions and assessments, (3) a web browser-based method to rapidly create intelligent tutoring systems and seamlessly integrate them into online courseware, and (4) an application of reinforcement learning for an evidence-based quality control for online courseware content. As a proof of concept, instances of CyberBook for a college level chemistry (stoichiometry) and high school math (coordinate geometry) will be created. To validate the feasibility of implementation, the proposed learning engineering methods will be applied to two existing online course platforms???Open Learning Initiative and Open edX. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be measured through a pilot evaluation study at the partner institutions. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Construction of Higher Education Management Data Analysis Model Based on Association Rules;"Zhao, Fanfei; Zhang, Guanqun; Wang, Zhaoli; Hao, Xiangyu";2022;SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING;Article;WoS;10.1155/2022/5414238;;;;Yes;This paper adopts the analytical method of intelligent programming to conduct in-depth research and analysis on university education management and designs a corresponding university education management model to be applied in actual teaching. Based on the basic theories and methods of big data distributed data mining and machine learning, automated machine learning, and big data programming computational methods, this paper combines the importance and technical challenges of the algorithms themselves and the background of the practical application needs of the industry and firstly selects a series of data mining and machine learning algorithms that are commonly used based on high complexity, outstanding computational efficiency problems, and difficult to design distributed algorithms. The research on efficient large-scale distributed parallelized data mining and machine learning methods and algorithms is carried out. As an innovative teaching model, the experiential teaching model focuses on the cultivation of individual students' independent learning ability and subjective initiative, which not only can effectively activate the classroom atmosphere and improve the teaching effect but also meet the requirements of classroom teaching for the development of the times. The empirical evidence of the experiential teaching model proposed in this paper is carried out, and the implementation process of the experiential teaching model of high school physics is further improved. In terms of the overall implementation effect, the experiential teaching model proposed in the paper can deepen students' understanding of concepts and physical laws, thus enabling them to solve physics problems better, and has a positive and active effect on enhancing students' learning interests and attitudes. In the case of system security, the average comprehensive index of each unit is 61.11, 22 are higher than the average index, accounting for 61.11%, 14 are lower than the average index, accounting for 38.89%, and 23 management departments' management systems passed the safety monitoring, accounting for 63.89%. At the same time, the proposed model also provides educational practitioners with a more reliable framework for instructional design, which has realistic reference value and significance.
SBIR Phase I: Trains of Thought, a novel game-based learning curriculum module to teach STEM and entrepreneurship skills;;2014;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This SBIR Phase I project proposes to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Trains of Thought, a novel game-based learning curriculum module to teach STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and entrepreneurship skills to high school students. This project has significant intellectual merit. US kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) STEM education is falling behind global standards (National Science Board, 2007; US Department of Labor, 2007), and current educational practice is not doing enough to prepare our students to compete in the global economy. Trains of Thought explores new applications of game-based learning to this problem. The approach combines (1) proven educational research in preparation for future learning (Schwartz & Martin, 2004) and guided experiential learning with scaffolding (Hmelo-Silver, Duncan, & Chinn, 2007); (2) an existing, popular, open source business simulation video game; and (3) artificial intelligence experience management (Weyhrauch, 1996), (Roberts, 2011), (Mott & Lester, 2006) to balance educational objectives with engaging gameplay, maintaining a sense of flow. The project builds upon emerging educational research results to develop a fundamentally new methodology for game-based learning. If successful, this effort should set new standards for the use of games for teaching STEM and entrepreneurship in K-12 classrooms. The broader/commercial impact of the proposed research, curriculum module, and accompanying game software can help to reverse the trend of declining US STEM and entrepreneurship education. This effect directly supports our future business leaders in driving American innovation and our nation's long-term economic prosperity. The transformative concept of effective game-based learning has the potential to reach out to under-represented demographics in STEM-based entrepreneurial businesses - including women, African-American, Hispanic, and Latino populations - by providing students new ways to engage, interact, and learn from core educational content. The knowledge gained from the proposed effort also has significant implications to the scientific and educational communities for the design and application of game-based learning. Our principles, methods of development, and evaluation outcomes may form a model for developing additional curriculum modules on a variety of subjects, therefore increasing effectiveness of US STEM and entrepreneurship education in a wider context. These results may also spur new research efforts to refine and extend our findings in game-based learning, creating more effective STEM and entrepreneurship education in future efforts."
CAREER: Advancing Atomic-Level Understanding of Kinetically Driven Solid-Solid Phase Transitions from First Principles and Machine Learning;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research to advance the fundamental understanding of solid-solid phase transitions. Most materials have several different stable crystalline structures, each with a characteristic set of physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Carbon, which can form graphite (flaky, black material used in pencils) or diamond (hard, colorless gemstone) structures, is a well-known example. Solid-solid transitions that occur between different crystalline forms of the same compound are ubiquitous and important phenomena. They can lead to a wide variety of technologically important applications such as diamond and steel production, synThesis of ceramic materials, thermal energy harvesting and storage, rewritable optical data storage, and nonvolatile electronic memories. Historically, considerable progress has been made in understanding solid-solid transitions from thermodynamics concerning the relative phase stability (the ???driving force??? for the phase transition), regardless of transition paths between the initial and final structures. However, the kinetics that dictates whether or not the transition can occur in practice under given environmental conditions and which path the transition likely takes place remain poorly understood. This project will advance the atomic-level understanding of kinetics underlying solid-solid transitions without using empirical data and develop an advanced artificial intelligence method for the fast and accurate prediction of kinetic barriers that control solid-solid transition in various environments. The data and methods acquired will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community and the general public through open-source distributions and publications. Education and outreach activities are integrated in this project with the goal to inspire and develop a diverse, globally competitive next generation STEM workforce in computational materials science that will benefit the State of Maine as well as the nation. The research team will (i) develop a ???kinetics-driven phase-change materials by design??? module for high school students in collaboration with the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education, (ii) develop an advanced courses in ???computational materials physics and modeling??? for seniors and graduate students in science and engineering departments at the University of Maine, (iii) expand the partnership between the University of Maine and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to provide students the opportunity to take advantage of facilities and computational resources in the national laboratory to expand their experiences beyond the traditional university setting, and (iv) create a summer research fellowship program to provide opportunities for talented undergraduates majoring in science, engineering, and mathematics to conduct computational materials research. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research to advance atomic level understanding of solid-solid phase transitions. Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous phenomena that play key roles in diverse technologies across physics, chemistry, biology, materials science and engineering. Despite having been studied for over a century, the fundamental understanding of phase transition kinetics remains largely qualitative or phenomenological; the atomistic mechanism of such transition processes and design rules for controlling kinetics are still crucially missing. This project will advance atomic-level understanding of kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions using a combined method of modern first-principles electronic structure theory calculations, quantitative chemical bond analysis, and machine learning. The specific objectives are to (i) identify physical principles and structural motifs that control kinetic barriers of polymorphic transitions from first principles, and (ii) develop a bottom-up physics-driven machine learning method for the fast and accurate prediction of transition barriers. The study will be carried on a set of select well-known phase-transition materials that are technologically important for energy and electronic applications. The research will accelerate the design and discovery of new functional phase-change materials where kinetics is essential. Education and outreach activities are integrated in this project with the goal to inspire and develop a diverse, globally competitive next-generation STEM workforce in computational materials science that will benefit the State of Maine as well as the nation. The research team will (i) develop a ???kinetics-driven phase-change materials by design??? module for high school students in collaboration with the Maine Center for Research in STEM Education, (ii) develop an advanced courses in ???computational materials physics and modeling??? for seniors and graduate students in science and engineering departments at the University of Maine, (iii) expand the partnership between the University of Maine and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to provide students the opportunity to take advantage of facilities and computational resources in the national laboratory to expand their experiences beyond the traditional university setting, and (iv) create a summer research fellowship program to provide opportunities for talented undergraduates majoring in science, engineering, and mathematics to conduct computational materials research. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research through the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).

PRISM: UCI Interdisciplinary computational and applied mathematics program;;2009;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The principal investigators (PIs) propose a research experience program in computational and applied mathematics for lower-division undergraduate students at UC Irvine (UCI). Through this experience, the PIs seek to stimulate student interest in mathematics and computer science, and provide positive mentoring to students early in their college education. The intellectual merit is in developing an integrated teaching and research program at the interface of mathematics and computer science for freshman and sophomore students at UCI. The projects in the program are extracted from current research in information sciences and machine learning with applications in signal processing, internet search, collaborative filtering and game theory. The program involves mentoring of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who actively participate in teaching and advising of undergraduate students. Undergraduate students shall develop creative thinking and programming skills which prepare them well for success in upper division classes and pursuit of advanced degrees. The program is based on on-line resources and its curriculum is portable. Early stimulation and nurturing of mathematical interest of undergraduate students is a key step in improving the overall quality of undergraduate education, and strengthening the nation's output of talented young generations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The computing based mathematics learning and research in early stage of college education lays the solid foundation of creative mathematical thinking for students in the context of their modern daily life. This will stimulate their interest in learning advanced topics of mathematics, science and engineering in junior and senior years, and transition to innovative scientists and engineers in the future. The proposed program aims to generate broad impact in advancing discovery and understanding while promoting postdoctoral fellow and graduate student career training, undergraduate student learning and research. The program strives for student diversity and shall actively recruit minority students from local high schools and existing minority student programs at UCI. The project results will be disseminated at national conferences and on-line to a broad range of audience in public. The early computing based learning of mathematics will bring out a new generation of creative and well-prepared scientists for our society to benefit for years to come.
EAGER: AI-DCL: Collaborative Research: Understanding and Overcoming Biases in STEM Education using Machine Learning;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Diversity is the cornerstone of innovation and essential for the progress of science. However, the number of female students in engineering, computing, and physical sciences in the United States remains strikingly low. The lack of diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is, to a significant extent, due to biases at different stages of schooling (e.g., different perceptions of math achievements by male and female students, lack of encouragement for female student enrollment in advance placement classes, stereotypes influencing college course selection). These biases appear as early as middle school: a critical period when student's educational experience can significantly influence their academic choices in high school and, ultimately, in deciding whether or not to enroll in STEM majors in college. In order to broaden the participation of women in STEM, it is critical to identify factors and practices in middle school learning environments that may attract (or repel) students into science. This award will use machine learning (ML) to develop new, automated, and data-driven methods for discovering and monitoring biases in STEM classrooms, focusing on middle school and early adolescence science and mathematics education. The project combines methods from social psychology, machine learning, and information theory to create algorithmic tools that monitor middle school student, teacher, and school-level data for factors that impact students' engagement in STEM. These tools will (i) help identify pedagogical or socio-economic factors that have a disparate impact on the decisions made by female students, (ii) predict which students are most vulnerable to being discouraged from pursuing STEM fields, and (iii) inform effective interventions that help close the gender gap. Despite its potential, the use of ML in education is a double-edged sword: while ML algorithms may be able to flag discriminatory patterns, they can also propagate biases and have an unwarranted disparate impact if left unchecked. Thus, in parallel, this project also aims to characterize the fairness challenges involved in deploying ML in education settings. The proposed approach will be validated on a dataset collected during a five year period from middle school students from across the United States. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
SISTEMAS: Stimulating Immersive Science Through Engaging Motivating and Authentic Scenarios;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Abstract: SISTEMASThe focus of the SISTEMAS proposal is to support and equip underrepresented students, with a particularfocus on Latinx Multilingual Learners (LML), to enter the STEM pipeline and persist. The proposal addressesthe issue at the beginning of the pipeline, when children often decide whether they can do science and math,and whether they can become future scientists. The research team hypothesizes that if students are exposedto inclusive, strategically designed learning environments in which they develop their scientific literacy and 21stcentury problem solving skills, more students will consider science as a possible career choice. The project isarticulated in four specific aims that include: (1) creating two new versions of Virtual Vet, a narrative rich readaloud version and Spanish version, to reach a more diverse student population with the international, award-winning serious game; (2) developing a new immersive environment, Virtual Vet Middle Grades, that targets adeeper understanding of the human body through the study of genetics; (3) creating a responsive andcustomized environment in Virtual Vet that leverages deep learning approaches to provide timely feedback tostudents and teachers; and (4) developing a 5-day STEM camp on the campus of the University of Georgia inthe Genetics department to provide inclusive and ambitious science learning experiences specificallysupporting LML students by providing instruction in English and Spanish. Through partnership with six schooldistricts, more than 6,000 students will garner access to Virtual Vet and Virtual Vet Middle Grades. This samplesize will equip the research team to examine student knowledge, attitudes toward science, interest in pursuinga science field, and students' mindset toward learning with a particular focus on how novel translanguagingsupports equip LML learners to succeed in science in a digital environment."

CAREER: Applied Model Theory;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project centers around two broad applications of model theory. The first is related to algebra and number theory, and the second is in machine learning. Model theory is a part of mathematical logic which has seen extensive applications in other areas of mathematics and computer science in the last several decades. The project aims to resolve several long-standing problems related to number theory and algebraic differential equations. Number theory and differential equations are central areas of mathematics with applications throughout the sciences, and this project aims to resolve fundamental questions in these areas. Connections between model theory and machine learning have emerged in the last several years, and this project seeks to build on those connections to bring new techniques to both disciplines. In the past several years open problems in both model theory and machine learning have been resolved using techniques from the other, a process this project will continue. Machine learning has emerged as one of the most influential technologies of the last decade and is in the process of rapid growth, and this project aims to attack foundational problems in machine learning using techniques from mathematical logic. The education component of the project involves training of graduate students and undergraduate students through research and outreach to high school students. The first main area of this project centers around nonlinear ordinary differential equations which arise in a number of classical contexts. The project will study the differential equations satisfied by automorphic functions and apply the results to prove new transcendence results as well as obtaining diophantine applications around unlikely intersections. Here, the techniques include analysis, differential Galois theory, and geometric stability theory. Painleve equations will be studied, where the central goal is a classification of the algebraic relations between solutions. The second main area of this project is machine learning. In this area, model theoretic tools will be brought to bear to solve foundational open problems in learning theory. For instance, combinatorial characterizations of private versions of learnability in various settings will be pursued. Learnability in automata and other specific mathematical structures will also be pursued. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

CNS Core: Small: FLINT: Robust Federated Learning for Internet of Things;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Federated learning enables machine learning on distributed datasets without needing the learner to access directly the datasets owned by respective stakeholders. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a fertile ground for applying federated learning, where distributed IoT devices produce a plethora of data that are often private. However, IoT devices are vulnerable to environments with inaccurate data samples and malicious attacks, which is a significant challenge for federated learning. Agglomerating data in a federated and robust manner may produce benefits to the economy and society. Objectives of the Robust Federated Learning for Internet of Things (FLINT) project include: (1) Formulate federated learning (FL) in heterogeneous, dynamic IoT environments with unreliable and adversarial clients. (2) Design new FL algorithms that are robust against hostile conditions with benign, unreliable, and malicious clients injecting erroneous or poisonous data. (3) Design novel incentive mechanisms to ensure rational clients gain non-negative utility by contributing training data and resources. (4) Analyze complexity, performance, and theoretical bounds of proposed algorithms. (5) Build an IoT testbed to study the learning performance of robust FL solutions. (6) Simulation experiments on real-world datasets to evaluate performance scalability. The FLINT project will offer graduate and undergrad students a unique opportunity to gain interdisciplinary education in the design of robust FL algorithms for IoT. Research findings will enrich courses on cyber-physical systems and machine learning for IoT. The project will attract women and underrepresented minority students, and attract primary and secondary school students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Dissemination of research results will be by means of the project website, seminars and keynote talks, conference presentations, and publications in top-tier journals and conference proceedings. The FLINT project website (https://tluocs.github.io/FLINT/) will maintain computational codes, models, real world and experimental data for two years after the project period is over. The website will provide two levels of access ??? Public and Login required ??? and an account can be created via registration with no charge. An accompanying GitHub repository will make the developed codes and simulation models available to the community. Permission will be granted to use and distribute freely the data and code with due acknowledgement of the copyright notice and the authors. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

CAREER: Enabling Predictable Performance in Cloud Computing;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Cloud computing allows tenants, such as Netflix and Expedia to economically rent compute and storage resources from providers. To enable low resource prices, providers consolidate multiple tenants onto a single physical server. However, this sharing of physical resources among tenants often leads to contention, resulting in unpredictable performance. Worse, tenants cannot observe resource contention due to the opaque nature of cloud computing. This project will develop novel performance models to estimate resource contention in opaque cloud deployments. These models will then be leveraged to develop solutions for cloud tenants that mitigate performance variation, thus enabling predictable performance in clouds. To realize predictable performance, the project will proceed along two integrated fronts. On the theoretical front, the project will develop uncertainty-aware stochastic performance models. These models will then be integrated with control-theoretic and machine learning techniques to infer, at runtime, the unobservable model parameters in a cloud environment. On the systems front, armed with the uncertainty-aware models, the project will develop solutions, including task schedulers and resource managers, that alleviate application performance variation. The solutions will be designed to dynamically detect and diagnose performance interference. All models and solutions will be experimentally evaluated in public and private clouds. The interdisciplinary nature of the project provides unique opportunities for integrated education and outreach. The primary benefit of the project will be increasing cloud adoption and promoting its broader impact on energy efficiency. To facilitate this goal, the project will develop open-source solutions for platforms such as OpenStack. The project will advance interdisciplinary education by developing performance analysis lectures and modules that will be integrated with existing courses taught in the departments of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and the College of Business. Outreach activities will focus on creating research opportunities for local area high school students. All data produced as a result of this project, including models, software solutions, publications, and courseware, will be made publicly available at the project repository: http://www.pace.cs.stonybrook.edu/predictable-clouds.html. The project data will be maintained and made available for at least 10 years, and even longer, if needed. Data will be stored and hosted on local web servers, and will also be replicated on external public web servers, such as those provided by github, which offer long-term durability and reliability.

CAREER: Transportation Network Maintenance under Climate Change, Resource Uncertainties, and Connectivity;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This Early Faculty Career Development (CAREER) project aims to improve transportation network maintenance with a focus on the growing severity and frequency of natural disasters due to climate change, resource uncertainties, and emerging data sources and implement an education program for next-generation transportation engineers, high school students, and the existing workforce with a focus on holistic thinking from a multidisciplinary perspective. Natural disasters substantially compromise regional transportation network???s mobility performance, reduce economic productivity, and create significant safety hazards to travelers. Transportation agencies in the United States spend more than $2.3 billion annually for winter roadway maintenance alone. Systematic considerations of the uncertainty of long-term regional weather patterns due to climate change, maintenance resources, and new data sources can significantly improve the resilience of a resource-intensive transportation network maintenance. This project will lay the groundwork for transforming traditional static transportation network maintenance operations into the next-generation data-driven and dynamic program that will reduce transportation infrastructure maintenance time and costs and minimize adverse societal impacts. The education program will train next-generation transportation professionals and the existing workforce and foster school students??? interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The goal of this project is to advance the scientific discovery in transportation network maintenance operations under growing climate change-induced adverse weather risks and uncertainties for the formulation of a robust, efficient, flexible, and reliable maintenance program. Advanced data-driven and machine learning-based emerging network modeling and analysis techniques will be developed to advance the understanding of the interrelationship between transportation networks and maintenance demand uncertainties in a regional roadway network. This project will formulate and solve scientific problems critical for (i) understanding the dependency of different uncertainties in optimal maintenance activity center configuration at a regional scale, (ii) modeling the roadway condition observation location to improve the forecast of the transportation network condition and traffic pattern for timely and effective roadway maintenance, (iii) formulating the maintenance operations considering weather and resource uncertainties in a data-intensive environment, and (iv) characterizing the all-electric maintenance operations and charging infrastructure.

Representational Fluency and How It Can be Developed in Primary School Students;Zaqoot, Wisam M. R.;2022;;Dissertation/Thesis;WoS;;;;;Yes;
CAREER: Parameter-free Optimization Algorithms for Machine Learning;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Machine Learning (ML) has been described as the fuel of the next industrial revolution. Yet, current state-of-the-art ML algorithms still heavily rely on having a human in the loop in order to work properly. Indeed, the training process of a ML algorithm requires significant human intervention through twisting and tuning of the many knobs of the algorithm. Moreover, most of the time this tweaking process is carried out without any theoretical guidelines. The most common options for the ML practitioners are to follow their intuitions or to exhaustively evaluate all the possibilities, making the overall time needed to train these algorithms difficult to predict. In this project, the investigator aims at designing truly parameter-free training algorithms for ML, to remove the burden of human parameter-tuning and make ML algorithms more scalable. The investigator also proposes an Education Plan that is designed to fill the gap between theoretical and applied ML in the minds of most students. It will involve a collaboration with the PROgram in Mathematics for Young Scientists (PROMYS), to introduce the study of very basic concepts of the theory of machine learning to both high school students and teachers, and with the women???s Smith College. The project stems from new methods the investigator has recently introduced to design optimal parameter-free optimization algorithms, e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent without learning rates, for the particular case of convex functions. In this project, the investigator proposes to go beyond convex functions. In particular, the investigator plans to pursue the following inter-related aims: 1. Computational complexity of learning without prior knowledge. The objective is to fully characterize the computational complexity of learning, without assuming knowledge of unknown quantities, in worst and easy cases. In other words, if a learning algorithm needs parameters to achieve optimal performance, the goal is to fully characterize the overall computational complexity, including the search for the optimal parameters. 2. Non-convex stochastic optimization without parameters. The project's goal is to generalize recent results on parameter-free optimization to deal with the non-convex problems in modern ML algorithms. The investigator plans to use a novel optimization framework that mixes elements of Online Mirror Descent with Dual Averaging, the two frameworks used to design optimization algorithms. 3. Reducing parameters in optimization for Deep Learning. Deep Learning models are the most parameter-heavy in ML. The project considers three applications of the project's research to widely used deep-learning algorithms: adaptive scaling heuristics, saddle-point optimization, and Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
SBIR Phase I: Tile Farm: A Versatile Math Education App That Promotes the Development of Spatial, Numeracy, and Higher-Order Thinking Skills;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This SBIR Phase I project will develop a geometry-based mathematics application that allows students to experience the elegance and beauty of math while developing higher order numeracy and thinking skills. This project challenges the context of how students relate to mathematics in traditional rote fashions, and how many populations negatively self-identify with math. It proposes that a dynamic visual interface of design and game-based activities can transform the way math is perceived, making it more accessible, enjoyable, and impactful. This project has already shown the potential for making this impact, and teachers, parents, and students (ranging from Kindergarten to a project-centered college course) have all recognized the project's ability to engage users of all ages and catalyze this transformation. This project is aimed at proof-of-impact for early learners (Pre-K through 2nd grade) and helping students appreciate the elegance of math, especially for those with very little mathematical background. This will establish a foundation for expanded offerings for all ages and will pave clearer paths to STEAM careers through positive math identification and improved performance. This balance of engagement and transformational impact will establish a sustainable company able to compete in public and educational markets on an international scale. This project is seeking to advance its innovative interface by developing adaptive software that can be customized to serve design, game, and explore modes essential for the project's standalone value. To ensure visibility, this project will require cross-platform development for Google, Android, and iOS devices. Design Mode will allow students to efficiently create beautiful and complex patterns and allow teachers to customize lectures that can be reinforced by game mode. Game Mode will allow students to solve puzzles that improve their spatial and numeracy skills through engaging mechanics and representations. It will focus on finding ways of assessing if students are improving their higher order thinking skills by measuring the efficiency of their paths to solving problems with multiple solutions. Explore Mode will require a simple artificial intelligence tool to help students discover interesting patterns and learn how to make new creations based on their own designs. This project will be devoted to ensuring all modes of play meet the core curriculum requirements and NCTM standards (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) and will provide a foundation for the next wave of offerings, including an innovative 3-D interface and augmented reality functionality for middle and high school students. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Machine-Learning Construction of Energy-Stable Non-Newtonian Fluid Hydrodynamics with Molecular Fidelity;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Accurate modeling of non-Newtonian fluids is a longstanding challenge in computational mathematics, and plays a central role in the prediction and control of the fundamental diffusion, transport, and synThesis processes in fluid physics, chemical engineering, and materials science. Unlike simple fluids, non-Newtonian fluids often exhibit complex flow behaviors arising from the multiscale nature of the solute dynamics; canonical physical laws break down in general. Conventional hydrodynamic models are often based on empirical approximations of the microscale interactions, which require careful parameter tuning and generally show limited capability to retain molecular-level fidelity. This gap severely limits both the fundamental scientific understanding of multiscale transport balance laws and the predictive control in relevant engineering applications. This project aims to develop a new machine-learning computational tool to construct accurate and energy-stable non-Newtonian hydrodynamic models directly from the micro-scale descriptions. The models under development will encode heterogeneous molecular-level interactions and enable predictive modeling of multiscale fluids such as soft matter, polymeric liquids, and vesicle suspensions, where empirical models show limitations. The educational part of the project will provide a suite of interdisciplinary training and outreach activities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to promote data science education at the interface of computational mathematics and natural sciences. The direct connection between machine learning and computational mathematics is intended to provide truly interdisciplinary training for the next generation of the STEM workforce in this fast-growing field and to attract and retain a diverse population of students in the mathematics community. The project will also leverage an existing joint program with Spelman College to build a network of support for underrepresented students with interest in this field. The research project aims to deliver a novel approach for learning high-fidelity and truly reliable computational models of multiscale fluid systems. The main innovation will be the capability to seamlessly pass the microscale interactions to the macroscale dynamics without empirical approximations. In contrast to the results of some machine-learning-based modeling, the resulting model will retain a clear physical interpretation embedded with a fundamental energy form rather than a black-box fit of reduced dynamics and will be guaranteed to be energy stable. Moreover, the learning algorithm will only require discrete rather than time-series samples, and be well-suited for practical applications. The method aims to provide a unique approach to fundamental scientific understanding of the mesoscale transport balance law where the canonical Stokes-Einstein equation breaks down. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Collaborative Research: Engaging Adolescents through Collaboration on Simulated STEM Career Scenarios and Mathematics Activities;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Employment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields and attainment in STEM education need to reflect better the diversity of US population demographics. This disparity is especially concerning given projected shortfalls in skilled workers for jobs in STEM fields. This project will lead to the creation of virtual simulations of peer collaboration in STEM fields, designed for use by adolescents. Practice with these simulations will help adolescents build collaborative skills and career interest in STEM fields, especially those that use mathematics and require strong teamwork. By creating an innovative simulation to support mathematics collaborative skills development and STEM career identities, and grounding its use in informal learning environments that capitalize on youths??? cultural assets, this project will increase the likelihood that students historically underrepresented in STEM careers will persist in the STEM career pipeline. The project???s work will result in three simulation modules, program materials supporting their use in informal learning environments, and initial research evidence about their implementation and impacts. The simulations will feature authentic performance settings of STEM career scenarios with opportunities for repeated application of mathematical knowledge and collaborative skills. Simulation players will interact with virtual partners, receiving feedback to improve performance and emphasize the value of mathematics and collaboration in STEM careers. Adapted from an artificial intelligence platform used in healthcare training, the simulations??? virtual partners and their dialog will be based on recordings of mathematics collaboration in secondary school classrooms. Simulation content and supports will be informed by staff from strategic partners, Morehead Planetarium and Science Center (MPSC) and LatinxEd, that provide STEM-focused programming to African American, Latinx, and future first-generation college students. Six African American and Latinx STEM Career Partners will ground the simulations in authentic mathematics and collaborative industry practices that appeal to student users. A total of 96 African American and Latinx adolescents, and adolescents who are potential first-generation college students will serve as play-testers. An additional 80 participants enrolled in the strategic partners??? programs will engage in field-testing: playing each of three simulations, generating user data, and completing a transfer task of collaborative skills in mathematics and self-Report surveys about their STEM career interests and aspirations. Field-test data will be analyzed using multi-level models for nested data and repeated measures. Qualitative data collection will include observations of play and field testing, and interviews with program staff and industry consultants. Thematic analysis will inform curricular supports and improve implementation utility and feasibility. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

S&AS: INT: COLLAB: Goal-driven Marine Autonomy with Application to Fisheries Science and Management;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Marine robots can be used to accurately map and track marine life, leading to a better interpretation of variability and migration patterns that are important to fisheries managers in marine protected areas (MPAs). Principles of engineering and oceanography can be used to maximize the impact of a network of marine robots, but because fisheries managers, oceanographers, and roboticists have different perspectives and knowledge bases, it can be difficult to take advantage of cutting-edge research in each field without significant effort to translate among the groups. Researchers will develop a computational interface that translates human-specified missions of fisheries managers into multi-level planning for a fleet of marine robots to monitor fish populations in a dynamic coastal ocean environment. The system will be designed with input from fisheries managers through a series of workshops, and will be field-tested at Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary, a federally-managed MPA off the coast of Georgia. The research will lead to more accurate and effective ways to monitor fish populations in MPAs, as well as breakthroughs in key areas of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. Many of the results will be applicable to other smart and autonomous systems in challenging environments. In addition, the project will train graduate students and broaden undergraduate education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and offer a number of outreach activities, including working with the University of Georgia Marine Extension service to develop a summer camp for middle and high school students. The project is focused on developing an intelligent physical system (IPS) that consists of a heterogeneous fleet of marine robots, cooperatively tracking fish movement and surveying the habitat with minimum request for human intervention. The IPS will translate the human-specified missions of fisheries managers into goal-driven task designs for each robot, and automatically generate executable plans for the networked mobile sensing agents. The system will autonomously and persistently collect in-situ measurements and acoustic detections of fish species while maintaining multi-scale data streams and constructing multiple spatial-temporal maps reflecting the conditions of the ecosystem. The research aims to discover the hotspots (e.g., spatial locations with sustained congregations of fish), as well as illuminate more information about how and when fish move among these hotspots. This goal is quite challenging due to a number of gaps between project needs and the state-of-art autonomy research. Researchers will address the challenges through new developments that accomplish three main tasks: (1) Developing the goal-driven marine autonomy for fish habitat survey, (2) realizing the goal-driven autonomy on physical systems, and (3) evaluating the developed framework through real-life field work, experiments, and data analysis. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Three Decades of DIMACS: The Journey Continues;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;In 2019, both DIMACS (the Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science) and the National Science Foundation's Science and Technology Centers program celebrate thirty years of operation and thirty years of defining and shaping modern research. In today's dynamic research landscape, thirty years is a remarkable milestone, and one that this project proposes to commemorate with a major conference, Three Decades of DIMACS: The Journey Continues, that looks to the future as it honors the past when DIMACS was one of the original class of NSF Science and Technology Centers (STCs). The conference will explore future directions of traditional DIMACS topics and highlight emerging topics of growing importance. The conference will consider broad questions such as: What is the future of theoretical computer science? What are new challenges for algorithms? For discrete mathematics? How do they tie to applications areas? How do they connect to data science? To AI and machine learning? To privacy and fairness? Finally, the role of centers is changing in a world with instant communication, data everywhere, and disciplines increasingly merged to address fundamental problems of great variety. The conference will explore the implications for DIMACS, STCs, and other centers of various types. The planned program includes many women and underrepresented minorities as speakers and panelists and will highlight innovative programs for broadening participation in computer science and mathematics that may serve as models elsewhere. The program also features discussions of how to educate students to work across disciplinary boundaries and operate in a world where science has become an international activity and the nature of work will change in the age of intelligent machines. It features teachers describing their experiences with innovative education programs and materials that integrate mathematical and computational methods with science content for high school classrooms. Such programs hold promise for building a future workforce that is able to cross disciplinary boundaries and harness the power of computing to address future challenges. Presentations will also address current research that has global societal importance in areas such as sustainability and climate change, epidemiology, homeland security, privacy, and aspects of socially responsible algorithms. The conference will look to the future with presentations describing ongoing research and emphasizing important challenges and questions that will propel us into the next decade. It will emphasize important themes in computer science theory such as complexity and machine learning (particularly deep learning), as well as the socio-technical challenges, such as privacy and fairness, that arise in a world with increasingly intelligent machines and ubiquitous data. The conference will explore applications in robotics enabled by theory from statistical physics, computational challenges in ecology and related social sciences in the face of climate change, as well as new capabilities in healthcare made possible by advances from computational biology and mathematical epidemiology. Presentations will also look at current and future research directions in traditional DIMACS areas, such as discrete mathematics, optimization, and statistics and their central role in harnessing the data revolution. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
RAPID: DRL AI: Data Driven Approaches to Integrating AI in K-12 Education Using Social Media Analysis;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Large language models, especially ChatGPT, have seen exponential growth and have demonstrated early potential to transform teaching and learning. Given the rapidly changing field, there are limited systematic studies on how students and teachers are engaging with these new generative AI tools, leaving schools with little to no data to help them integrate AI in K-12 education. This RAPID project aims to develop a general framework and accompanying computational tools to understand how students and teachers are engaging with generative AI tools. By gaining insights into both the enthusiasm and concerns from teachers and students, the project seeks to equip AI integration teams with a deeper understanding of AI usage in educational settings. This understanding will help identify opportunities, and lay a foundation for transformative changes to K-12 education. The resulting data analytics will provide rich information about teachers' use, perceptions, fears, and frustration in adopting AI in the classroom. It will also offer new insights into students' use, trends, level of interest, and an initial view of their sense of responsible and ethical use of AI. Combined, this will inform the public on the digital readiness of teachers, students, and school districts, including responsible/ethical use of AI in the classroom and student preparation for careers in AI. The project will also potentially contribute to the AI standards in K-12 education. Furthermore, the project's findings will be broadly disseminated, with the primary objective of providing practical guidelines that can be incorporated into educational practices. This project proposes a data-driven approach to understand how high school teachers and students have begun using AI tools. The project will collect time-sensitive data from social media platforms and develop methods to identify topics and trends driving the exploration and use of AI tools by students and teachers. The key tasks in this project are as follows: 1) identifying social networks and related communities, 2) developing tools to collect relevant past and current posts, and 3) performing data analysis to identify topics, trends, and to elicit key challenges and opportunities for effectively using AI tools in teaching and learning. The data analysis workflows will be used to identify trends, topics, questions, and concerns among student and teacher groups. Topic modeling and user activity analysis will be used to develop student and teacher perspectives. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

Using Fine-Grained Quantitative and Qualitative Data to Enhance Curricula and Broaden Participation in Computer Science;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Florida State University, a Carnegie I Research University. Over its five- year duration, this project will fund four-year scholarships to 33 unique Scholars who are pursuing bachelor???s degrees in computing. The project objectives include: (1) identifying and recruiting students with financial need and academic talent; (2) improving retention through cohort class enrollments, dedicated tutors, and academic support; (3) providing internship and research opportunities to Scholars; and (4) gathering feedback to refine the computing curriculum. A distinguishing feature of this project is the application of natural language processing, machine learning, and traditional analyses to examine fine-grained qualitative and quantitative data related to student success. These analyses are expected provide insights into student retention, the computing curriculum, the effectiveness of current support systems, and how to encourage women and other underrepresented groups to major in computer science. The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high- achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. Although a growing number of jobs require expertise in computing, only 10% of STEM graduates study computer science. This project seeks to increase the participation of low-income, high- achieving students in computer science. To achieve this goal, the project strategies include high school outreach, dedicated tutors, student support systems, cohort enrollment, and replacing student loans with scholarships. This project will investigate the effectiveness of these activities using randomized control trial experiments. As part of this study, the project will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to analyze data from Experience Sampling Method surveys to identify and remediate gender and cultural biases in the computing curriculum. The expected outcomes of the project include identification of curriculum changes to encourage diversity and quantification of factors that contribute to student success in computer science. Project evaluation will include annual data collection and analyses of cohort demographics, academic performance, retention, use of support systems, reasons for separation, and placement. The research findings will be published at conferences such as SIGCSE, ASEE, FIE, and AERA. This project is funded by NSF???s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

Collaborative Research: AI4GA - Developing Artificial Intelligence Competencies, Career Awareness, and Interest in Georgia Middle School Teachers and Students;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies begin to reshape modern society, educating younger students about AI has become a national priority for both the United States and its competitors. In these early days of K-12 AI education, little is known about how diverse student populations relate to AI and which instructional strategies are most likely to engage them. Since most K-12 teachers are not yet familiar with AI, research is also needed on how to develop their AI fluency and confidence. This project, a collaboration between researchers in AI and education and the Georgia Department of Education, will investigate these questions by developing and testing a nine-week elective course for Georgia middle school students called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence, and an accompanying online teacher professional development course. The student course will offer a mixture of activities including hands-on demonstrations, guided experimentation, online research, project-based learning, and exploration of AI-enabled careers. Teachers will also have the option of including computer programming activities. To ensure that the curriculum is adaptable to the needs of different populations and cultures, researchers will partner with school districts serving three ethnically and geographically diverse populations in Georgia: rural, suburban, and urban areas, and with large populations of white, Latinx, or Black students respectively. Both courses will be developed in collaboration with a team of middle school teachers from these districts who will first receive training from the investigators in the basics of AI and in culturally responsive teaching. Working with these teachers as they pilot the course will provide an understanding of the challenges in teaching/learning the content and the types of support needed for diverse teachers and learners to succeed. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Over the three year project duration, 18 teachers drawn from 6 school districts will receive training in AI and culturally responsive instruction, and 1800 students will take the Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence course. The project will investigate four research questions: (1) What are middle school students' and teachers' knowledge of, interest in, comfort with, and attitudes towards AI technology and AI careers? (2) What types of technology-driven and innovative learning experiences are effective in increasing rural, Black, and Latinx/Hispanic middle school students' AI interest, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and interest in AI careers? (3) What AI knowledge and skills are developmentally appropriate for middle school students? and (4) What institutional or cultural barriers/accelerators prevent/promote course implementation? The research will use a mixed-methods design combining attitudinal surveys, in-class observations, subject interviews, student reflections, and examination of student artifacts. At the conclusion of the project, the professional development course will be made publicly available through the Georgia Department of Education web portal. Additional project deliverables include the middle school course materials, AI demonstration software developed to support the middle school course, the research findings, and measurements of the effectiveness of the curriculum for diverse learner populations when implemented by middle school teachers in their classrooms. The results will also be disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and social media. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
A Postdoctoral Fellowship in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Improving students' performance in STEM subjects is crucial for their future career readiness and the development of essential 21st-century skills. Policymakers have prioritized education initiatives to support U.S. students' achievement in STEM. However, evidence indicates ongoing challenges in increasing mathematics and science outcomes, particularly for students from minoritized groups, including students of color, low-income students, and students with disabilities. To address this issue, teachers need access to evidence-based interventions to tailor their instruction and meet these students' learning needs, thus increasing their access to the science and math curricula. Yet, there is still much to learn about the most effective math and science interventions for these students and the conditions that impact their effectiveness. High-quality, comprehensive reviews of studies on math and science interventions focused on these students are suitable for identifying the most promising instructional practices and the conditions under which they are effective. By conducting these reviews, we can identify effective strategies and techniques to improve math and science outcomes for these students, promoting fair and equitable access to the mathematics and science curricula, and ultimately contributing to more inclusive and effective educational practices. However, a lack of scholars, especially those from minoritized backgrounds, with advanced knowledge and skills in conducting high-quality reviews to identify evidence-based mathematics and science practices for these students remains a challenge. The post-doctoral program aims to prepare the next generation of scholars with expertise in conducting high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on math and science outcomes for K-12 students from minoritized groups. The program emphasizes situated learning research, cohort-building, and networking to prepare a cohort of post-doctoral fellows to acquire and apply advanced techniques for conducting high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses to identify evidence-based interventions for increasing these students' mathematics and science proficiency. They will also explore sources of heterogeneity in these interventions to understand the conditions under which they are effective. The fellows will receive training in performing effective literature searches and coding procedures, using multilevel modeling to address complex data structures, implementing multilevel and multivariate modeling, and using machine learning algorithms for article screening and coding in hierarchical databases. Additionally, scholars will develop dissemination materials that assist teachers in effectively translating research into classroom practices. The project has the potential to contribute significantly to STEM education by increasing the number of scholars from minoritized backgrounds who can conduct high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on evidence-based practices for minoritized students. This, in turn, will lead to more equitable and effective instructional strategies, ultimately improving mathematics and science outcomes for historically underrepresented groups. This project is supported by NSF???s STEM Education Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (STEM Ed PRF) Program with co-funding from the Discovery Research PreK-12 Program (DRK-12). The STEM Ed PRF Program aims to enhance the research knowledge, skills, and practices of recent doctorates in STEM, STEM education, education, and related disciplines to advance their preparation to engage in fundamental and applied research that advances knowledge within the field. The DRK-12 Program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Deep Learning-Based Mental Health Model on Primary and Secondary School Students' Quality Cultivation;"Li, Shuang; Liu, Yu";2022;COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.1155/2022/7842304;;;;Yes;The purpose was to timely identify the mental disorders (MDs) of students receiving primary and secondary education (PSE) (PSE students) and improve their mental quality. Firstly, this work analyzes the research status of the mental health model (MHM) and the main contents of PSE student-oriented mental health quality cultivation under deep learning (DL). Secondly, an MHM is implemented based on big data technology (BDT) and the convolutional neural network (CNN). Simultaneously, the long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced to optimize the proposed MHM. Finally, the performance of the MHM before and after optimization is evaluated, and the PSE student-oriented mental health quality training strategy based on the proposed MHM is offered. The results show that the accuracy curve is higher than the recall curve in all classification algorithms. The maximum recall rate is 0.58, and the minimum accuracy rate is 0.62. The decision tree (DT) algorithm has the best comprehensive performance among the five different classification algorithms, with accuracy of 0.68, recall rate of 0.58, and F1-measure of 0.69. Thus, the DT algorithm is selected as the classifier. The proposed MHM can identify 56% of students with MDs before optimization. After optimization, the accuracy is improved by 0.03. The recall rate is improved by 0.19, the F1-measure is improved by 0.05, and 75% of students with MDs can be identified. Diverse behavior data can improve the recognition effect of students' MDs. Meanwhile, from the 60th iteration, the mode accuracy and loss tend to be stable. By comparison, batch size has little influence on the experimental results. The number of convolution kernels of the first convolution layer has little influence. The proposed MHM based on DL and CNN will indirectly improve the mental health quality of PSE students. The research provides a reference for cultivating the mental health quality of PSE students.
CAREER: Reinforcement Learning of the Free Energy Landscapes of Proteins;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Proteins are molecular machines that perform a variety of tasks in living organisms, such as transporting nutrients and communicating signals within and between cells. Some of these proteins undergo a change in their conformation or shape to carry out these functions. It is challenging to visualize the different shapes of these molecular machines using traditional experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the molecular level understanding of these processes and its implications for protein function remains elusive. This lack of molecular information makes it difficult to develop engineering approaches to regulate protein function. Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a way to observe these movements at the atomic scale. However, significant amount of computer time is required to observe long timescale conformational change processes in proteins. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop efficient algorithms based on machine learning techniques to understand how proteins undergo conformational change and (2) to apply these algorithms to understand the role of protein dynamics in transport of molecules across the cell membrane via membrane transporters. The specific transporters investigated in this project play a critical role in determining crop productivity and neurological disorders in humans. In concert with these research objectives, the PI will develop outreach activities teaching high school girls about computational methods used to investigate protein function via Girl's Adventure in Mathematics, Engineering and Sciences summer camp at the University of Illinois. PI also plans to engage African-American boys at local Urbana-Champaign schools via a three-day after-school program to teach them about protein structure and function. This project will develop computational methods that can efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein conformational changes. This work is guided by the hypoThesis that leveraging ideas from reinforcement learning technique and using evolutionary coupled residue pair distances as order parameters for protein functional dynamics will allow efficient sampling of free energy landscapes. The development of the algorithm called Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Sampling (REAP) has been initiated. Preliminary results have shown promising application of these ideas to several proteins. The fully developed algorithm would be particularly useful for systems with limited structural information, as order parameters can be identified using evolutionary coupled residues based on sequence information alone. The specific goals of this project include: (1) further develop the REAP methodology to efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein function, (2) test the new methodology to understand molecular processes of high biological importance but with limited availability of structural information. In particular, molecular mechanisms of substrate transport and its regulation for the following transport processes will be investigated: (1) Nitrate transport process via root-associated transporters in plants with applications in increasing the crop yields. (2) Serotonin transport in brain via human Serotonin transporter for elucidating molecular origin of neurological disorders. (3) Sugar transport via SWEET family transporter in Rice with applications in enhancing plant growth. Despite differences in their function and structures, these systems share similarities in terms of their modes of regulation that could allow for a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in membrane transporters. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Collaborative Research: Exploring Algorithmic Fairness and Potential Bias in K-12 Mathematics Adaptive Learning;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Students in middle school and high school often use adaptive learning software as part of their math education experience. Adaptive learning software works by automatically measuring how much students have learned about the topic, as well as their learning process and experiences, and then adjusting the instruction accordingly. This project will investigate potential ways in which adaptive learning software might be biased against students from certain groups, and how such biases can be reduced. Adaptive learning offers an opportunity to provide high quality instruction that is personalized to the needs of individual learners, but little is known about who benefits most from adaptive learning technologies. This project will address this issue by observing and interviewing students who use adaptive math learning software to discover what aspects of their identity are most salient in the adaptive learning context. This project will then investigate possible algorithmic biases related to the identities that students express. Findings from the project will contribute to understanding of the most relevant aspects of student identity in adaptive learning contexts, and how those identities affect their learning experience. Finally, this project will address the biases that are identified, thereby providing a more equitable mathematics education experience for students. Modern adaptive learning platforms individualize learning support and improve learner outcomes by using algorithms that are typically derived through machine learning. Previous work has studied biases in educational model accuracy for large groups (e.g., ethnic and gendered categories, urban vs. rural, etc.); however, large groups may have a great deal of heterogeneity, and little is known about which specific groups of students suffer from biases in model accuracy and why. This project will approach the problem of potential bias in three steps. First, the project will begin by collecting data on educational software usage patterns (i.e., logs of actions and classroom observations of student experiences) for students using MATHia, a math education platform used by over half a million students across the United States. As part of this data collection, students will describe their identity in open-ended survey responses and interviews, which will be analyzed to discover identity characteristics that shape their learning experiences. Second, existing machine learning models will be applied to these data to predict knowledge, engagement, and self-regulated learning behaviors, and the predictions will be analyzed to reveal cases where models are systematically biased. Third, the project will compare various pre-processing, in-processing, and post- processing methods for bias reduction, and study the effects of the improved algorithms when applied in MATHia. Results from this project will contribute to scientific understanding of the role of student identity in adaptive learning software, biases in machine learning for educational software, and the effects of applying machine learning methods for bias reduction. This project is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development, with co-funding by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program.

Collaborative Research: AI4GA - Developing Artificial Intelligence Competencies, Career Awareness, and Interest in Georgia Middle School Teachers and Students;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies begin to reshape modern society, educating younger students about AI has become a national priority for both the United States and its competitors. In these early days of K-12 AI education, little is known about how diverse student populations relate to AI and which instructional strategies are most likely to engage them. Since most K-12 teachers are not yet familiar with AI, research is also needed on how to develop their AI fluency and confidence. This project, a collaboration between researchers in AI and education and the Georgia Department of Education, will investigate these questions by developing and testing a nine-week elective course for Georgia middle school students called Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence, and an accompanying online teacher professional development course. The student course will offer a mixture of activities including hands-on demonstrations, guided experimentation, online research, project-based learning, and exploration of AI-enabled careers. Teachers will also have the option of including computer programming activities. To ensure that the curriculum is adaptable to the needs of different populations and cultures, researchers will partner with school districts serving three ethnically and geographically diverse populations in Georgia: rural, suburban, and urban areas, and with large populations of white, Latinx, or Black students respectively. Both courses will be developed in collaboration with a team of middle school teachers from these districts who will first receive training from the investigators in the basics of AI and in culturally responsive teaching. Working with these teachers as they pilot the course will provide an understanding of the challenges in teaching/learning the content and the types of support needed for diverse teachers and learners to succeed. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Over the three year project duration, 18 teachers drawn from 6 school districts will receive training in AI and culturally responsive instruction, and 1800 students will take the Living and Working with Artificial Intelligence course. The project will investigate four research questions: (1) What are middle school students' and teachers' knowledge of, interest in, comfort with, and attitudes towards AI technology and AI careers? (2) What types of technology-driven and innovative learning experiences are effective in increasing rural, Black, and Latinx/Hispanic middle school students' AI interest, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and interest in AI careers? (3) What AI knowledge and skills are developmentally appropriate for middle school students? and (4) What institutional or cultural barriers/accelerators prevent/promote course implementation? The research will use a mixed-methods design combining attitudinal surveys, in-class observations, subject interviews, student reflections, and examination of student artifacts. At the conclusion of the project, the professional development course will be made publicly available through the Georgia Department of Education web portal. Additional project deliverables include the middle school course materials, AI demonstration software developed to support the middle school course, the research findings, and measurements of the effectiveness of the curriculum for diverse learner populations when implemented by middle school teachers in their classrooms. The results will also be disseminated through conference presentations, scholarly publications, and social media. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
PIC: Hybrid Photonic-Electronic Reprogrammable Reservoir Computing with Polarization Modes-enhanced Dimensionality;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The recent success of Machine Learning methods based on brain-inspired Neuromorphic Computing (NC) to perform complex information processing tasks spiked significant research in new unconventional computational schemes such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and RNN-based Reservoir Computing (RC) which are capable to implement parallel data processing to overcome limitations of conventional sequential computing. Particularly, decomposing the reservoir into an inner network with static weights and an output neurons layer with adaptive and trainable weights allows realization of physical RC where optical-based RC platforms are attractive due to the ???speed-of-light??? propagation, inherent parallelism, relatively low operation power, and the possibility to harness additional degrees of freedom such as polarization and wavelength. Furthermore, on-chip Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) offer enhanced light-matter interaction and modes polarization for enlarged reservoir, and interconnection with CMOS compatible electronics for power efficient electrical reprogrammable feedback. The proposed physical RC PICs are expected to impact mobile applications such as unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV) and robotic platforms by reducing the need for communication with remote computers, thus avoiding latency and prolonging battery life. (technical description) To realize the reservoir computing (RC) processor utilizing the polarization degrees of freedom on a photonic integrated chip (PIC), we propose the following objectives: (1) numerical and theoretical study aiming to explore the effect of introducing polarization as a new degree of freedom on RC efficiency depending on the underlying architecture of PIC with the electronic feedback elements providing dynamics control; (2) design, fabricate and characterize silicon PIC interconnected with external electronic feedback, admitting the designed architectures; (3) experimentally test the PIC system with external electronic feedback to realize reprogrammable RC tasks, validate the theoretical study and evaluate its performance for relevant applications providing higher accuracy and lower energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art. Rapid prototyping and testing will be performed at UCSD with full scale runs performed at the AIM Photonics foundry. The proposed research is transformative in nature as it will: (i) greatly expand the limits of applicability of RC in CMOS compatible PIC platforms, (ii) develop a fundamental understanding on the effect of reprogrammability on the induced reservoir dynamics and the corresponding performance error, (iii) expand the current notions of both RC and the optical degrees of freedom employed for RC (e.g., polarization). The transformative broader impact of the project arises from the creation of a new much faster and more efficient RC PIC accelerator that will impact mobile applications such as UAV and robotic platforms. The project will provide scientific training for students at graduate and undergraduate levels as well as serve as a basis for outreach, education and collaborative efforts with middle and high schools. Engagement of students of diverse ethnicity, gender and economic backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) will be continued via the ongoing RET, REU, and COSMOS activities. The program will continue developing a plug & play Integrated Photonics Education Kit (IPEK) and disseminate it to other institutions to implement hands-on classes for a large number of students with diverse origins and gender, and workforce population in the U.S. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
RTG: Mathematical Foundation of Data Science at University of South Carolina;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This Research Training Group (RTG) project is a joint effort of Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering. It aims to develop a multi-tier Research Training Program at the University of South Carolina (UofSC) designed to prepare the future workforce in a multidisciplinary paradigm of modern data science. The education and training models will leverage knowledge and experience already existing among the faculty and bring in new talent to foster mathematical data science expertise and research portfolios through a vertical integration of post-doctoral research associates, graduate students, undergraduate students, and advanced high school students. A primary focus of this project is to recruit and train U.S. Citizens, females, and underrepresented minority (URM) among undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs through research led training in Data Science. The research and training infrastructure implemented through this RTG program will not only support the planned majors and master???s degrees, but also provide systemic educational curricula for students and researchers from other areas whose research would benefit from Data Science within UofSC and in the vicinity. The training materials created by this RTG program will also be widely available to other institutions across the country. The RTG project will help build a highly educated workforce for academia, government and industry, in the area of data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This project is a response to emerging demands of modern technology-oriented societies for an innovative workforce with expertise in all areas related to Data Science. Based on a comprehensive view of Data Science, the program aims at providing students and postdocs with the necessary concepts that enable them to form their own research agenda. Our program covers, on the one hand, emerging developments in network science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and optimization methodologies from computer science and statistical perspectives primarily for the Big-Data regime with applications such as autonomous systems. In addition, problems typically posed in a Small-Data regime can relate these concepts to relevant methodologies, such as Physics Informed Learning, needed to understand mathematical models, usually formulated in terms of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), so as to understand key techniques for synthesizing models and data in the context of Uncertainty Quantification. Properly interrelating these activities in the broader Data Science landscape, will enable students to successfully tackle new problem areas at later stages of their career and address important challenges in sciences and engineering. The corresponding theoretical training is reinforced by accompanying practical training modules that are able to engage students across all levels as well as young researchers in synergistic activities, even reaching out to local industries. It is a feedback-loop between research and education that distinguishes the project. The educational component is designed with an ultimate goal of developing an innovative research training program to educate future workforce in a structured curriculum that offers a major, a master???s degree and a 4+1 dual degree in Data Science at UofSC. The project facilitates team-teaching by relevant experts and uses direct links to research projects that students will participated in. The built-in vertical and horizontal pedagogical synergies as well as the hierarchical mentoring scheme expose participating students to extensive educational and research experience offered by the program. This project is jointly funded by Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering in Mathematical and Statistical Sciences (CDS&E-MSS), the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Workforce Program in the Mathematical Sciences, among others. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
GSE/RES Learning Companions as Change Agents: Improving Girls' Self-efficacy Beliefs in Learning Math;;2005;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Utah State University is investigating the educational potential of virtual peers to change girls' negative self-images and attitudes toward science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), moving them in a desirable direction. The virtual peers, called pedagogical agents as learning companions (PALs), may encourage and persuade girls to increase their belief of self-efficacy in learning math and to build more positive attitudes toward pursuing careers in STEM. Research indicates that girls' negative views of the fields of STEM are often due to social and cultural influences. Family, schools, and media are likely to impose stereotypic role expectations on girls and infuse girls with ideal Barbie doll images of girls. As a result, many girls tend to identify STEM as masculine and doubt their ability to compete. Girls need to be exposed to social environments that will encourage them to overcome ungrounded social stereotypes and build constructive views of their competency in STEM. Although the stereotypic views of family, teachers, or friends cannot be immediately changed or influenced, girl-friendly virtual social environments can be created to help girls build positive attitudes toward STEM. The project will 1) investigate the effectiveness of PALs in facilitating girls' self-confidence and efficacy in learning math and 2) investigate the characteristics of PALs critical to that end. To reach the goals, a three-year research agenda is planned. In the first year, the project will focus on the effects of the gender and age of PALs. The research will investigate whether gender (male vs. female) and age (adult vs. peer) are related to girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the second year, the project will focus on the effects of the competency and ethnicity of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' competency (strong vs. weak) and ethnicity (Caucasian vs. Hispanic) have an impact on Caucasian and Hispanic girls' choices of PALs as their learning partners and, subsequently, girls' self-efficacy and attitude change. In the third year, the project will concentrate on the effects of the feedback type and emotion of PALs. The research will be an investigation of whether PALs' feedback type (harsh vs. nice) and emotion (empathetic vs. non-empathetic) will have an impact on girls' attribution of their success and failure, their self-efficacy, and their feelings of affability with PALs. The research questions will be answered using a quasi-experimental design and both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will include approximately 200 9th-grade girls in required algebra I classes in public high schools in large and mid-size cities in a mountain-west state of the USA. Intellectual Merit First, unlike most technology-based interventions that have been focused on the cognitive aspect of learning, this project is geared toward the affective aspect of girls' math learning. This project will identify how PALs can be used to effect girls' math self-efficacy and positive attitude toward learning math. Second, PALs are a special subset of pedagogical agents and are grounded on findings from human-peer interaction research. This project will identify the specific characteristics of PALs that might affect girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. Third, PAL-based interventions will be implemented in ordinary classrooms regularly throughout the semester. This project will provide classroom-based evidence on the educational value of PALs in K-12 settings and implications for long-term use. Broader Impacts The project is conducted through the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team and so will yield implications for multiple communities, such as researchers in women/gender education, STEM education in general, educational technology, human/computer interaction, and artificial intelligence in education. If found to be effective, PALs are potentially an efficient and cost-effective intervention to re-shape girls' STEM beliefs and attitudes, compared to human-mentoring programs. Through classroom implementation, the project has implications for PALs' role for improving Caucasian and minority girls' math self-efficacy and attitudes. The influential characteristics of PALs for PAL/learner relations identified in the project will provide implications for research on human relations as well as on human/computer interactions.
CAREER: Exploring Creative Expression through Music and Audio Technology;;2007;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Music contributes substantially to every culture on Earth, and the enjoyment of music is nearly universal. The appeal of music is that it provides expression to our own emotions, and it follows logically that individuals would want some creative input to that expression. Historically the primary exposure to music has been through live performance, providing audiences an opportunity for interaction with the musicians and music, but today the vast majority of music is experienced through recordings. And though recent digital audio technologies have had a tremendous impact on the world of recorded music, its fundamental nature remains unchanged: once a recording is made, that single performance is forever fixed, preventing any true interaction with the listener. The proposed work integrates research in digital audio technology with educational activities under a common vision of transforming the act of listening to recorded music into an interactive experience in which the performance responds to the creative input of the listener. Central to this vision is a concept known as Structured Audio, a semantic object-based representation of sound. The specific work activity consists of the following efforts: . Structured Sound Modeling (SSM) of musical instruments, which uses a novel signal processing and machine learning framework to facilitate a greater degree of musically expressive control than can be achieved with existing models for sound synThesis. . Development of the Structured Audio Platform (SAP), consisting of devices and software that employ these new instrument models to provide an expanded artistic palette for music producers and interfaces enabling nonmusicians to interact with their music by controlling creative aspects of the performance. An outreach program that uses music technology to attract students to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by demonstrating the contributions of these disciplines to modern music production as well as the creativity inherent within STEM and related fields. With respect to intellectual merit, there are many methods of modeling musical instrument sounds, but most are limited in their ability to capture the full expressive range of those instruments. The project will employ a novel framework for modeling time-varying sounds using jointly estimated parameters of an excitation-resonance model to derive a HiddenMarkovModel (HMM) of expressive sound. This framework employs an analysis/synThesis scheme: input sound is parameterized by the model and can be regenerated from the model parameters. This process has been used to model the singing voice and can be applied to other instruments, resulting in high sound quality while retaining a full range of musical expression. Knowledge gained through this project will also benefit other machine listening applications, such as audio identification and sound sensing. The research activity includes the development of a custom platform of devices and interfaces that offer artists new creative options and allow non-musicians to also provide creative input to their music. A key area of research will investigate appropriate mappings from the expressive controls of SSM instruments to a simple, low-dimensional interface for musical novices. Creativity is a difficult subject to study quantitatively, but this project presents a framework from which a small subset of creative expression can be assessed and analyzed. The educational activities of this project are designed to broadly impact students at many levels. The proposed outreach program will introduce high school students, particularly from underrepresented groups, to the technology of digital music, revealing the influence of science and engineering on music performance, recording, and listening. By engaging students' affinity for popular music the program seeks to foster curiosity in science and technology. The research component of the proposal will also be directly integrated into this program via custom music devices that allow students to creatively interact with music in Structured Audio format. This confluence of engineering and art has the potential to incubate interest in both fields. Given the diminishing support for music education in the public school system, this multi-disciplinary approach may be a solution to sustaining creative arts in the curriculum. The proposed research integrates knowledge from a wide range of areas. Participating graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training in fields such as acoustics, music theory, signal processing, performance practice, and machine learning.
Predicting academic achievement from the collaborative influences of executive function, physical fitness, and demographic factors among primary school students in China: ensemble learning methods;"Sun, Zhiyuan; Yuan, Yunhao; Xiong, Xuan; Meng, Shuqiao; Shi, Yifan; Chen, Aiguo";2024;BMC PUBLIC HEALTH;Article;WoS;10.1186/s12889-024-17769-7;;;;Yes;BackgroundElevated levels of executive function and physical fitness play a pivotal role in shaping future quality of life. However, few studies have examined the collaborative influences of physical and mental health on academic achievement. This study aims to investigate the key factors that collaboratively influence primary school students' academic achievement from executive function, physical fitness, and demographic factors. Additionally, ensemble learning methods are employed to predict academic achievement, and their predictive performance is compared with individual learners.MethodsA cluster sampling method was utilized to select 353 primary school students from Huai'an, China, who underwent assessments for executive function, physical fitness, and academic achievement. The recursive feature elimination cross-validation method was employed to identify key factors that collaboratively influence academic achievement. Ensemble learning models, utilizing eXtreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms, were constructed based on Bagging and Boosting methods. Individual learners were developed using Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms, followed by the establishment of a Stacking ensemble learning model.ResultsOur findings revealed that sex, body mass index, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory function, inhibition, working memory, and shifting were key factors influencing the academic achievement of primary school students. Moreover, ensemble learning models demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to individual learners in predicting academic achievement among primary school students.ConclusionsOur results suggest that recognizing sex differences and emphasizing the simultaneous development of cognition and physical well-being can positively impact the academic development of primary school students. Ensemble learning methods warrant further attention, as they enable the establishment of an accurate academic early warning system for primary school students.
OCT as a Platform for Non-Invasive Virtual H&E Biopsy;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The broad objective of this project is to develop imaging instrumentation and algorithmic technology toperform non-invasive, real-time, in-vivo, 3D, virtual H&E biopsies. One in four people worldwide willultimately be affected by cancer. Surgical removal is the main treatment for most solid cancers. The surgeon istasked with the delicate balancing act of excising enough tissue to avoid leaving behind residual cancer cellswhile not removing too much tissue, which can harm organ function. This is particularly important for braintumors, the most common type of solid tumor in children and the leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality. Thegold standard for detecting most solid cancers and confirming tumor margins is hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)stained tissue sections, which require an invasive biopsy procedure. Unfortunately, current non-invasive in-vivoimaging modalities do not produce images of comparable usefulness. We propose a novel imaging modalitycalled a virtual H&E biopsy'' that would generate H&E-like images of living tissue in real time. non-invasively upto 1 mm into the tissue. This imaging modality would be able to provide real-time diagnosis of tumor margins andinvasiveness by scanning a large tissue area for residual cancer cells. Such information would guide treatmentdecisions for diseases such as brain and skin cancer. Beyond its clinical benefits, this technology can also beused for research into tumor development and tumor responses to treatment by providing in-vivo H&E-likeimages of healthy and tumorous tissue microstructures changing over time.To generate virtual H&E images, we will optimize a new imaging instrument we have developed basedon optical coherence tomography (OCT) and image translation by a generative adversarial neural network(GAN). The key breakthrough enabling us to train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images is a technique calledoptical barcoding, which we used to obtain a dataset of OCT images and corresponding real H&E imagesaligned to single-cell precision. We have demonstrated this virtual H&E system with ex-vivo human skin tissuesamples. For the proposed project, we will first train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images of healthy mousebrain tissue and glioblastoma mouse brain tissue ex-vivo (Aim 1 ). Second, we will use transfer learning to retrainthe GAN to generate virtual H&E images of mouse brain tissue of in-vivo OCT scan (Aim 2a), and track for thefirst time how H&E images change as a mouse glioblastoma tumor develops (Aim 2b}. Finally, we will assesswhether the GAN can be retrained across species by applying transfer learning on the mouse-brain trained GANand use it to generate a virtual H&E biopsy of ex-vivo low-grade human glioma (Aim 3). To the best of ourknowledge, this will be the first time transfer learning has been applied across species for biomedical images.Such transfer learning can accelerate virtual biopsy research since mouse samples are significantly easier toobtain and handle, thereby opening up applications in locations where acquiring a human dataset for training avirtual biopsy GAN would be difficult or impossible to achieve (e.g., the retina).

The key breakthrough enabling us to train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images is a technique calledoptical barcoding, which we used to obtain a dataset of OCT images and corresponding real H&E imagesaligned to single-cell precision. We have demonstrated this virtual H&E system with ex-vivo human skin tissuesamples. For the proposed project, we will first train a GAN to generate virtual H&E images of healthy mousebrain tissue and glioblastoma mouse brain tissue ex-vivo (Aim 1 ). Second, we will use transfer learning to retrainthe GAN to generate virtual H&E images of mouse brain tissue of in-vivo OCT scan (Aim 2a), and track for thefirst time how H&E images change as a mouse glioblastoma tumor develops (Aim 2b}. Finally, we will assesswhether the GAN can be retrained across species by applying transfer learning on the mouse-brain trained GANand use it to generate a virtual H&E biopsy of ex-vivo low-grade human glioma (Aim 3). To the best of ourknowledge, this will be the first time transfer learning has been applied across species for biomedical images.Such transfer learning can accelerate virtual biopsy research since mouse samples are significantly easier toobtain and handle, thereby opening up applications in locations where acquiring a human dataset for training avirtual biopsy GAN would be difficult or impossible to achieve (e.g., the retina).

AI Institute: Institute for Student-AI Teaming;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"A central challenge of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning is how to promote deep conceptual learning via rich socio-collaborative learning experiences. To meet this challenge, the Institute for Student-AI Teaming will reframe the role of AI (Artificial Intelligence) in education, moving towards a future where AI is viewed as a social, collaborative partner that helps students work and learn more effectively, engagingly, and equitably, while helping educators focus on what they do best: inspiring and teaching students. The Institute will develop, deploy, and study AI Partners that interact naturally with students and teachers through speech, gesture, gaze, and facial expression in real-world classrooms and remote learning settings. The AI partners will be designed in close collaboration with educators with the aim of supporting students to develop STEM competencies, disciplinary practices, and 21st century skills of collaborative problem solving and critical thinking. These AI Partners will observe, participate in, and support small groups of students to engage in deep and sustained learning conversations, while assisting teachers in orchestrating effective learning experiences at the individual, small group, and whole-class levels. The focal content domain will be AI education, thus contributing to growing a diverse workforce of future AI researchers and practitioners. The long-term impact of the Institute is to help realize the grand challenge of ???Education for All???, by leading the nation towards a future where all students ??? especially those whose identities are underrepresented in STEM ??? routinely participate in rich and rewarding AI-enabled collaborative learning experiences that scale across a large number of classrooms, resulting in deeper student engagement and persistence in STEM, more inclusive classroom cultures, and significant improvements in learning outcomes. The Institute will support workforce development though sustained engagement of diverse youth and national dissemination of AI-enabled curricula. Realizing this impact will require the Institute to develop foundational advances in AI technology, consistent with the National AI Research and Development plan which calls for significant advances in human-AI collaboration. The Institute for Student-AI Teaming brings together a geographically distributed team of researchers from nine Universities (University of Colorado Boulder; Colorado State University; University of California, Santa Cruz; University of California, Berkeley; Brandeis University; Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Georgia Institute of Technology; University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne; University of Wisconsin-Madison) with partners from academia, K-12 school districts, and industry. The Institute will adopt responsible innovation and polycultural approaches for developing ethical AI technologies by integrating foundational and use-inspired AI research across more than 12 interdisciplinary research areas - spanning the computing, learning, cognitive and affective sciences. This research program will be conducted in close partnership with K12 educators, gender and racially diverse students, parents, and other community stakeholders to ensure that the resulting technologies address community needs and reflect community values. Efforts will grow a diverse workforce of future AI researchers and practitioners by engaging 5,000 middle/high school students in innovative AI education through AI-enabled pedagogies. The Institute???s research program will yield fundamental advances in multimodal processing, natural language understanding, affective computing, and knowledge representation to develop AI models that can autonomously monitor the unfolding learning discourse at multiple levels ??? understanding the content, the conversational dynamics, gestures, and social signals??? and learn to generate appropriate dialog moves to be effective partners in the learning conversations. It will advance the new science of student-AI teaming in the form of theoretical frameworks, innovative interaction paradigms that consider the cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of the interaction, and novel human-AI architectures for orchestrating effective student and teacher interactions with AI learning partners. The Institute will advance the science of inclusive co-design by developing methodologies to empower diverse stakeholders to envision, co-create, and critique AI technologies for their schools and communities. These advances will be achieved through a highly interdisciplinary research methodology blending algorithm development, user-centered design, neurophysiological modeling, design-based research, curriculum co-design, and classroom field trials. Research products, including curricula and software, will be openly and broadly disseminated, including sharing of data after establishing consent, data security, and privacy-protection. To promote collaboration and knowledge transfer, a dedicated Community Hub will provide services to integrate participants and partner organizations and will coordinate opening up the Institute to the broader community. The Institute will be evaluated along metrics of effectiveness, equity, efficiency, generalizability, and impact, both internally and via an external advisory board. Overall, the Institute will serve as a national nexus point for empowering diverse stakeholders to engage in responsible co-design of student-AI collaborative technologies. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
CAREER: Decoding the Structure and Energy Landscape of Isostatic Glasses by Machine Learning and Enhanced Sampling;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and education activities in the field of glass science. When cooled below their melting point, liquids usually turn into crystals. As an alternative route, liquids can bypass crystallization and enter a supercooled liquid state if quenched fast enough. At the glass transition temperature, liquids become so viscous that their flowing time eventually exceeds the observation time. At this point, since they are unable to flow, they freeze into solid glasses. Although virtually the entire periodic table can form a glass if quenched fast enough, the propensity for a liquid to crystallize or form a glass upon quenching, its glass-forming ability, depends on its composition. Deciphering how the atomic composition and structure of liquids govern their glass-forming ability has been at the very foundation of glass science and has remained largely unresolved thus far. To this end, the atomic structure of glasses can be described based on the concept of network topology, that is, the branch of mathematics that studies how the connectivity of nodes, in this case - the atoms, govern the properties of networks, the glass atomic structure. Interestingly, glasses exhibiting an optimal network topology, called isostatic, tend to feature unique properties, including maximum glass-forming ability. However, the nature of the linkages between network topology and glass-forming ability remains largely unknown. To address these questions, the PI seeks to decode the relationship between network topology and glass-forming ability, and so, interrogates the very nature of a glass and works toward understanding the origin of the anomalous properties featured by isostatic glasses. This will be accomplished by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling, and machine learning activities, which are closely integrated to inform and advance each other. This project will focus on chalcogenide glasses, which are the base material for 3D Xpoint phase-change random access memory. By storing 3 bits per cell instead of a single bit, this technology is widely believed to constitute the future of non-volatile memory. These research tasks are complemented and enabled by several educational activities. The PI will develop a series of cross-disciplinary courses to equip students with transversal knowledge, which is a key skillset to develop integrated solutions that globally address complex real-world challenges. The PI will also leverage this project to promote data-based adaptive learning, which offers a unique opportunity to move away from the one size fits all way of learning that does not reflect complex cognitive processes. To address the gender imbalance in engineering, the PI will develop an undergraduate research program targeted to female students, which aims to enhance their retention in graduate school. TECHNICAL SUMMARY This CAREER award supports research and education activities to advance fundamental understanding of structural glasses. Based on their network topology, structural glasses can be classified as flexible (underconstrained), stressed-rigid (overconstrained), and isostatic (rigid, but free of stress) when the number of topological interatomic constraints is lower, higher, or equal to the number of atomic degrees of freedom, respectively. Interestingly, optimally-constrained isostatic glasses tend to exhibit anomalous properties, including optimal glass-forming ability and low propensity for relaxation. Such isostatic glasses have been suggested to exist within an intermediate phase, wherein the glass self-organizes to exhibit a nearly-reversible glass transition. However, the existence and origin of the intermediate phase remain debated and no structural signature of this phase has been revealed thus far. Further, the origin of the anomalous properties of isostatic glasses remains elusive. To address these gaps in knowledge, the PI seeks to decode the relationship between network topology, propensity for relaxation, and glass-forming ability. To this end, the PI will adopt an integrated approach, wherein classical molecular dynamics, density functional theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning activities mutually inform and advance each other. First, a machine-learned forcefield will be trained to simulate archetypical Ge-As-Se chalcogenide glasses. Second, this forcefield will be used to decode the relationship between topology and propensity for relaxation, and interrogate the existence of the intermediate phase. Third, a structural signature of self-organization will be sought using machine learning. Last, enhanced sampling techniques will be used to characterize the energy landscape of glasses with varying network topologies. By synergistically combining physics- and data-driven modeling techniques, this research will reveal how the relationship between network topology, propensity for relaxation, and glass-forming ability is encoded in the topography of the energy landscape. This study will also interrogate the existence, origin, and signatures of the intermediate phase and structural self-organization in chalcogenide glasses. This project also supports an extensive education plan. First, the PI will introduce a cross-disciplinary program connecting condensed matter, civil engineering, and computer science. Second, the machine learning techniques developed herein will be used to enable data-informed active learning in classrooms. Third, active collaborations with industrial partners will be leveraged to expose students to industrial environments and corporate cultures. Fourth, the PI will develop an undergraduate research program targeted to females, so as to enhance their retention in graduate school. Finally, the PI will collaborate with local high school teachers to develop demonstration modules, with activities involving virtual reality, structural truss kit set, and sugar glass crystallization to support material science outreach to K-12 students. Through these activities, the project will contribute to supporting glass science in the United States. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
What would the matrix do?: a systematic review of K-12 AI learning contexts and learner-interface interactions;"Moore, Robert L.; Jiang, Shiyan; Abramowitz, Brian";2023;JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION;Review;WoS;10.1080/15391523.2022.2148785;Yes;;Yes;Yes;This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence's instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synThesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration.
Aligning AIED Systems to Embodied Cognition and Learning Theories;"Arroyo, Ivon; Rasul, Injila; Crabtree, Danielle; Castro, Francisco; Poh, Allison; Gattupalli, Sai; Lee, William; Smith, Hannah; Micciolo, Matthew";2024;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION: POSTERS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS, WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION TRACKS, PRACTITIONERS, DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM AND BLUE SKY, AIED 2024, PT I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_1;;;;Yes;"Embodied Learning involves the development of perceptuo-motor schemas as students manipulate physical objects that embody a concept, or when students move in domain-relevant ways, physically enacting solutions to problems, as well as gesturing as they interact with peers face-to-face. Teaching standards (e.g., for K-12 math education) align with such theories of learning. For instance, teachers are encouraged to have students talk mathematics, construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, model with mathematics, and use tools with precision, among others. Yet most learning technologies and tutoring systems are not designed to facilitate embodied learning; instead, they tend to align with more traditional views of student learning. This paper explores possible ways AIED systems can reflect embodied learning theories, within K12 STEM education. We present the WearableLearning platform as an example that intends to bring embodied learning to mathematics and computing education for students at the K-12 level, with implications and suggestions on how to use Artificial Intelligence to make embodied learning environments more effective."
Automatic Short Answer Grading in College Mathematics Using In-Context Meta-learning: An Evaluation of the Transferability of Findings;"Michael, Smalenberger; Sohrabi, Elham; Zhang, Mengxue; Bara, Sami; Smalenberger, Kelly; Lan, Andrew; Heffernan, Neil";2024;ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION: POSTERS AND LATE BREAKING RESULTS, WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS, INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION TRACKS, PRACTITIONERS, DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM AND BLUE SKY, AIED 2024, PT I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_38;;;;Yes;Mathematics teachers use open-ended (OE) problems to inspire creativity, facilitate learning by self-explanation, and encourage transfer learning. While these types of problems are pedagogically valuable, student answers often exhibit a combination of language and mathematical expressions, and the variation in these responses can make it difficult and time-consuming to assess. There have been growing efforts to research automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) methods to support teachers with this crucial task with promising results at the K12 level. However, whether these findings transfer to other student groups or across content, specifically at the college level, remains an open question. We implement a machine learning model for ASAG developed on K12 content and student responses and evaluate the transferability of previous findings to those at the college level. Our results show that the transferability can vary significantly, buttressing the assertion that this line of investigation warrants future research.
Artificial intelligence in education research during 2013-2023: A review based on bibliometric analysis;"Guo, Shuchen; Zheng, Yuanyuan; Zhai, Xiaoming";2024;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-024-12491-8;;;;Yes;Research on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has rapidly progressed in recent years, and understanding the research trends and development is essential for technological innovations and implementations in education. Using a bibliometric analysis of 6843 publications from Web of Science and Scopus, we found that China, US, India, Spain, and Germany led the research profuctivity.

Artificial Intelligence in Primary and Secondary Education: A Systematic Review;Shin, Dongjo;2020;The Journal of Educational Research in Mathematics;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;Recently, the education system has been changing rapidly with the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the COVID-19 global pandemic. In this situation, this study reviewed 51 international research studies that used artificial intelligence in the context of primary and secondary education 2015-2020. The results of this study show that artificial intelligence was used most frequently in mathematics education and mainly for learning fractions and linear equation. Studies that used artificial intelligence in education were most likely to be conducted for elementary and middle school students, and quantitative methodology was mainly used to examine the impacts of artificial intelligence on students’ achievement and affective domains. Systems that used artificial intelligence tended to be in the form of intelligent tutoring systems that provide step-by-step tutoring and adaptive, personalized feedback. In these systems, teachers tended to play minor roles, assisting the interaction between students and the artificial intelligence system.
Using fair AI to predict students' math learning outcomes in an online platform;"Li, Chenglu; Xing, Wanli; Leite, Walter";2024;INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS;Article;WoS;10.1080/10494820.2022.2115076;;;;Yes;As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.
Practical early prediction of students' performance using machine learning and eXplainable AI;"Jang, Yeonju; Choi, Seongyune; Jung, Heeseok; Kim, Hyeoncheol";2022;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-022-11120-6;;;;Yes;"Predicting students' performance in advance could help assist the learning process; if at-risk students can be identified early on, educators can provide them with the necessary educational support. Despite this potential advantage, the technology for predicting students' performance has not been widely used in education due to practical limitations. We propose a practical method to predict students' performance in the educational environment using machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We conducted qualitative research to ascertain the perspectives of educational stakeholders. Twelve people, including educators, parents of K-12 students, and policymakers, participated in a focus group interview. The initial practical features were chosen based on the participants' responses. Then, a final version of the practical features was selected through correlation analysis. In addition, to verify whether at-risk students could be distinguished using the selected features, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, LightGBM, VTC, and STC. As a result of the experiment, Logistic Regression showed the best overall performance. Finally, information intended to help each student was visually provided using the XAI technique."

A Holistic Approach to Use Educational Robots for Supporting Computer Science Courses;"Mamatnabiyev, Zhumaniyaz; Chronis, Christos; Varlamis, Iraklis; Himeur, Yassine; Zhaparov, Meirambek";2024;COMPUTERS;Article;WoS;10.3390/computers13040102;;;Yes;Yes;Robots are intelligent machines that are capable of autonomously performing intricate sequences of actions, with their functionality being primarily driven by computer programs and machine learning models. Educational robots are specifically designed and used for teaching and learning purposes and attain the interest of learners in gaining knowledge about science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics. Educational robots are widely applied in different fields of primary and secondary education, but their usage in teaching higher education subjects is limited. Even when educational robots are used in tertiary education, the use is sporadic, targets specific courses or subjects, and employs robots with narrow applicability. In this work, we propose a holistic approach to the use of educational robots in tertiary education. We demonstrate how an open source educational robot can be used by colleges, and universities in teaching multiple courses of a computer science curriculum, fostering computational and creative thinking in practice. We rely on an open-source and open design educational robot, called FOSSBot, which contains various IoT technologies for measuring data, processing it, and interacting with the physical world. Grace to its open nature, FOSSBot can be used in preparing the content and supporting learning activities for different subjects such as electronics, computer networks, artificial intelligence, computer vision, etc. To support our claim, we describe a computer science curriculum containing a wide range of computer science courses and explain how each course can be supported by providing indicative activities. The proposed one-year curriculum can be delivered at the postgraduate level, allowing computer science graduates to delve deep into Computer Science subjects. After examining related works that propose the use of robots in academic curricula we detect the gap that still exists for a curriculum that is linked to an educational robot and we present in detail each proposed course, the software libraries that can be employed for each course and the possible extensions to the open robot that will allow to further extend the curriculum with more topics or enhance it with activities. With our work, we show that by incorporating educational robots in higher education we can address this gap and provide a new ledger for boosting tertiary education.
History of Logo;"Solomon, Cynthia; Harvey, Brian; Kahn, Ken; Lieberman, Henry; Miller, Mark L.; Minsky, Margaret; Papert, Artemis; Silverman, Brian";2020;PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL;Article;WoS;10.1145/3386329;;;Yes;Yes;Logo is more than a programming language. It is a learning environment where children explore mathematical ideas and create projects of their own design. Logo, the first programming language explicitly designed for children, was invented by Seymour Papert, Wallace Feurzeig, Daniel Bobrow, and Cynthia Solomon in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN).Logo's design drew upon two theoretical frameworks: Jean Piaget's constructivism and Marvin Minsky's artificial intelligence research at MIT. One of Logo's foundational ideas was that children should have a powerful programming environment. Early Lisp served as a model with its symbolic computation, recursive functions, operations on linked lists, and dynamic scoping of variables.Logo became a symbol for change in elementary mathematics education and in the nature of school itself. The search for harnessing the computer's potential to provide new ways of teaching and learning became a central focus and guiding principle in Logo language development. It encompassed a widening scope that included natural language, music, graphics, animation, story telling, turtle geometry, robots, and other physical devices.
Use of ChatGPT in college mathematics education;"LEE,, SANGGU; Park, Doyoung; Lee, Jae Yoon; Lim, Dong Sun; Lee, Jae Hwa";2024;The Mathematical Education;research-article;WoS;;;;;Yes;This study described the utilization of ChatGPT in teaching and students’ learning processes for the course Introductory Mathematics for Artificial Intelligence (Math4AI) at ‘S’ University. We developed a customized ChatGPT and presented a learning model in which students supplement their knowledge of the topic at hand by utilizing this model. More specifically, first, students learn the concepts and questions of the course textBook by themselves.Then, for any question they are unsure of, students may submit any questions (keywords or open problem numbers from the textBook) to our own ChatGPT at https://math4ai.solgitmath.com/ to get help. Notably, we optimized ChatGPT and minimized inaccurate information by fully utilizing various types of data related to the subject, such as textBooks, labs, discussion records, and codes at http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/Math4AI-ChatGPT/. In this model, when students have questions while studying the textBook by themselves, they can ask mathematical concepts, keywords, theorems, examples, and problems in natural language through the ChatGPT interface. Our customized ChatGPT then provides the relevant terms, concepts, and sample answers based on previous students’ discussions and/or samples of Python or R code that have been used in the discussion. Furthermore, by providing students with real-time, optimized advice based on their level, we can provide personalized education not only for the Math4AI course, but also for any other courses in college math education. The present study, which incorporates our ChatGPT model into the teaching and learning process in the course, shows promising applicability of AI technology to other college math courses (for instance, calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, engineering mathematics, and basic statistics) and in K-12 math education as well as the Lifespan Learning and Continuing Education.
Affordances and challenges of artificial intelligence in K-12 education: a systematic review;"Crompton, Helen; Jones, Mildred, V; Burke, Diane";2024;JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION;Review;WoS;10.1080/15391523.2022.2121344;;;;Yes;Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) has experienced a rapid rise in the past decade. This systematic review is the first examining the use of AIEd in K-12 including 169 extant studies from 2011 to 2021. This study provides contextual information from the research, such as the educational disciplines, educational levels, research purposes, methodologies, year published and who the AI was intended to support. The grounded coding revealed affordances fit into three main themes of AIEd connecting to pedagogies (e.g., gaming, personalization), administration (e.g., diagnostic tools), and subject content. Challenges in AIEd K-12 included issues toward negative perceptions, lack of student and teacher technology skills, ethical concerns, and issues directly with the ease of use and design of the AI tools.

We collected and analyzed 9 papers as the primary literature and 11 domestic and foreign policy Reports as the secondary literature. The collected literatures were analyzed by applying a descriptive reviews, and the implications were derived by analyzing the curriculum components and TPACK elements for multi-dimensional analysis. As a result of this study, AI education targets were divided into three steps: AI users, utilizer, and developers. In K-12 education, the user and utilizer stages are appropriate, and artificial intelligence literacy must be included for user education. Based on the current computing thinking ability and coding ability for utilizer education, the implication was derived that it is necessary to target the ability to create creative output by applying the functions of artificial intelligence. In addition to the pedagogical knowledge and the ability to use the platform, The teacher training is necessary because teachers need content knowledge such as problem-solving, reasoning, learning, perception, and some applied mathematics, cognitive / psychological / ethical of AI.
K-12 Education in the Age of AI: A Call to Action for K-12 AI Literacy;"Wang, Ning; Lester, James";2023;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1007/s40593-023-00358-x;;;;Yes;"The emergence of increasingly powerful AI technologies calls for the design and development of K-12 AI literacy curricula that can support students who will be entering a profoundly changed labor market.

Unlike K-12 science and mathematics education, there is not currently a research foundation for K-12 AI education. In this article we provide a component-based definition of AI literacy, present the need for implementing AI literacy education across all grade bands, and argue for the creation of research programs across four areas of AI education: (1) K-12 AI Learning & Technology; (2) K-12 AI Education Integration into STEM, Language Arts, and Social Science Education; (3) K-12 AI Professional Development for Teachers and Administrators; and (4) K-12 AI Assessment."
Are perfect transcripts necessary when we analyze classroom dialogue using AIoT?;"Wang, Deliang; Chen, Gaowei";2024;INTERNET OF THINGS;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.iot.2024.101105;;;Yes;Yes;Classroom dialogue plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning. Many researchers have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) to develop models and systems for automatic analysis and feedback. However, the question of whether we should employ these AIoT tools on automatic transcripts of classroom dialogue generated by automatic speech recognition software or on transcripts that have undergone human revision remains unresolved, which involves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Thus, this paper examines whether perfect transcripts are needed to analyze talk moves in classroom dialogue. We initially constructed two deep learning models to analyze teacher talk moves in K-12 mathematics lessons. Subsequently, we collected an additional set of six K-12 mathematics lesson videos and used a classroom dialogue analysis system equipped with speech recognition software to automatically transcribe them, resulting in ASR_pure transcripts. These transcripts were then manually revised and verified to create ASR_human transcripts. A comparison between the two types of transcripts revealed evident errors in the ASR_pure transcripts. Next, we employed the developed AI models to predict talk moves in both ASR_pure and ASR_human transcripts and assessed their consistency. The findings demonstrate a high level of consistency in talk move prediction between the two types of transcripts across the six lessons. Furthermore, the ASR_pure transcripts also exhibit high consistency in specific talk moves (e.g., pressing for accuracy) when compared to ASR_human transcripts. We propose a hypoThesis that this consistency between inaccurate ASR_pure transcripts and perfect ASR_human transcripts can be attributed to the ASR software accurately recognizing key indicators that serve as talk moves, rather than accurately identifying every word. Notably, upon removing the key indicator words from teacher utterances, both the talk move level and lesson level consistency experience a substantial decline. Therefore, we suggest that perfect transcripts of classroom dialogue may not be necessary for AIoT to analyze teacher talk moves and provide teachers with prompt and accurate feedback, especially when the ASR software can accurately recognize keywords.
Automated Student Group Collaboration Assessment and Recommendation System Using Individual Role and Behavioral Cues;"Som, Anirudh; Kim, Sujeong; Lopez-Prado, Bladimir; Dhamija, Svati; Alozie, Nonye; Tamrakar, Amir";2021;FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.3389/fcomp.2021.728801;;;Yes;Yes;Early development of specific skills can help students succeed in fields like Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Different education standards consider Collaboration as a required and necessary skill that can help students excel in these fields. Instruction-based methods is the most common approach, adopted by teachers to instill collaborative skills. However, it is difficult for a single teacher to observe multiple student groups and provide constructive feedback to each student. With growing student population and limited teaching staff, this problem seems unlikely to go away. Development of machine-learning-based automated systems for student group collaboration assessment and feedback can help address this problem. Building upon our previous work, in this paper, we propose simple CNN deep-learning models that take in spatio-temporal representations of individual student roles and behavior annotations as input for group collaboration assessment. The trained classification models are further used to develop an automated recommendation system to provide individual-level or group-level feedback. The recommendation system suggests different roles each student in the group could have assumed that would facilitate better overall group collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop such a feedback system. We also list the different challenges faced when working with the annotation data and describe the approaches we used to address those challenges.
An In-Depth Methodology to Predict At-Risk Learners;"Ben Soussia, Amal; Roussanaly, Azim; Boyer, Anne";2021;TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED LEARNING FOR A FREE, SAFE, AND SUSTAINABLE WORLD, EC-TEL 2021;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-86436-1_15;;;;Yes;Nowadays, the concept of education for all is gaining momentum thanks to the widespread use of e-learning systems around the world. The use of e-learning systems consists in providing learning content via the Internet to physically dispersed learners. The main challenge in this regard is the high fail rate particularly among k-12 learners who are our case study. Therefore, we established an in-depth methodology based on machine learning models whose objectives are the early prediction of at-risk learners and the diagnosis of learning problems. Going through this methodology was of a great importance thus it starts by identifying the most relevant learning indicators among performance, engagement, regularity and reactivity. Then, based on these indicators, we extract and select the adequate learning features. For the modeling part of this methodology, we apply machine learning models among k-nearest neighbors (K-nn), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Decision tree on a real data sample of 1361 k-12 learners. The evaluation step consists in comparing the ability of each model to correctly identify the class of learners at-risk of failure using both accuracy and False Positive Rate (FPR) measures.
Toward learning progression analytics - Developing learning environments for the automated analysis of learning using evidence centered design;"Kubsch, Marcus; Czinczel, Berrit; Lossjew, Jannik; Wyrwich, Tobias; Bednorz, David; Bernholt, Sascha; Fiedler, Daniela; Strauss, Sebastian; Cress, Ulrike; Drachsler, Hendrik; Neumann, Knut; Rummel, Nikol";2022;FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.3389/feduc.2022.981910;;;;Yes;National educational standards stress the importance of science and mathematics learning for today's students. However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students' needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students' individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students' science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both - meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students' learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students' learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students' learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students' learning - the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.
Developing K-12 Education Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase student motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by developing guidelines for teaching and learning about artificial intelligence (AI) in K-12 school settings. Though AI is a quickly emerging field of research with broad applications in the STEM workforce and industry generally, there are few curriculum standards or educational guidelines for introducing pre-college students to fundamental knowledge and skills relating to the field of AI. This project will address the emerging need for greater guidance in this field by bringing together specialists in AI from academia and industry with specialists representing K-12 education to draft guidelines for teaching and learning about AI across the grade bands of K-12 schools. The draft guidelines will then be reviewed by a larger interest group representing specialists in AI and computer science, as well as representatives of K-12 educators more broadly and the general public. Feedback from this larger interest group will be used to refine the guidelines for broader dissemination. In addition to developing initial guidelines for AI education at the pre-college level, the project will create an online directory of resources that can be used by K-12 teachers to develop instructional experiences in AI for their students. The project team is working in association with the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) to model AI guidelines after CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards released in 2017. The project Steering Team includes members of AAAI and CSTA, as well as broad representation of AI scholars nationwide and experienced K-12 teachers across all grade bands. Efforts are being made to ensure that culturally relevant resources are identified and readily available to support implementation of the forthcoming guidelines with all student populations nationwide. The project team includes a Steering Committee that guides the project, and a larger Working Group consisting of experienced K-12 teachers at all grade levels and AI specialists representing academia and industry. An Advisory Group representing AI education nationally and internationally will provide additional guidance to the project. The project will employ mailing lists, a project website, and social media to engage the broader community of interested scholars, educators, researchers, and members of the general public. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
RAPID: Understanding and Supporting K-12 School Leaders' AI-related Decision-making;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The 2022 launch of ChatGPT has accelerated the need for school leaders (at both the district and building level) to make important and time-sensitive decisions related to the use of artificial intelligence in their schools. Given the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there are few established practices or guidelines for school leaders to rely on, and school leaders' current knowledge of artificial intelligence may be too limited to inform these decisions. Yet these decisions will have a great impact on future uses of artificial intelligence in K-12 education, as they will empower or constrain teachers' instructional decisions as well as the overall environment where learning takes place, ultimately affecting the realization of the potential of artificial intelligence to promote greater equity and inclusion in schools. Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide support to school leaders to inform policies and decisions related to the use of artificial intelligence in their schools. This RAPID project will contribute online resources for school leaders as well as new knowledge about the following questions: (1) What kinds of decisions have school leaders already made and expect to make about artificial intelligence? (2) What is school leaders' current knowledge of artificial intelligence and its applications in K-12 education, and what key questions do they have about artificial intelligence? (3) What are school leaders' attitudes towards artificial intelligence, and what risks and opportunities do they perceive about its applications to educational settings? (4) What resources could help inform school leaders' decisions about artificial intelligence, and how could these resources be effectively delivered? and (5) How do responses to the previous questions vary depending on the role/function of the school leader and/or characteristics of their school district? Data to address these questions will be gathered through a combination of interviews and a survey with superintendents, directors of technology, assistant superintendents for instruction and principals across all Western New York public school districts. The insights will be shared with the field to inform future research and interventions for school leaders to help them capitalize on artificial intelligence with the ultimate goal of achieving a more equitable, inclusive and effective K-12 education. Findings from the interviews and survey will also be used to inform the creation of publicly available online resources for school leaders to help address their most immediate needs. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
The Role of Learning Styles in Game-Based Learning;"Wouters, Pieter; van der Meulen, Esmee S.";2020;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GAME-BASED LEARNING;Article;WoS;10.4018/IJGBL.2020010104;;;;Yes;Adapting learning to the level and preferences of learners and game-based learning have increasingly received much attention. The current study examined whether learning styles based on the Felder-Silverman classification (perception, input, processing and organization of information) influence learning in GBL. Only the input and processing scales were found to be reliable. 109 students from prevocational secondary education played a math game (proportional reasoning) after which learning gain and motivation were measured. Gameplay yielded no learning, but a median-split breakdown (prior knowledge) indicated that students with little prior knowledge did learn from the game, while those with much prior knowledge deteriorated. Subsequent multiple regression analyses revealed no predictive effect for motivation. The processing preference was predictive for learning: Students with an active processing preference performed better than students with a reflective processing preference. The discussion discusses consequences and a number of directions for follow-up research.
Trends and Issues in STEM plus C Research: A Bibliometric Perspective;"Du, Hanxiang; Xing, Wanli; Pei, Bo; Zeng, Yifang; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Yuanlin";2022;CSEDU: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SUPPORTED EDUCATION - VOL 1;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.5220/0010998800003182;;;;Yes;The integration of computing education or computational thinking with STEM majors has gained substantial research interests. A number of research papers of the topic were published. This work is to provide a comprehensive overview of literature in the STEM + C field through both bibliometric and content analysis. We conducted a systematic search to identify articles and utilized machine-learning-based techniques to analyze these articles. Common bibliometric indicators were used for bibliometric analysis. Machinelearning-based text mining techniques such as LDA topic modelling and flow analysis were used for content analysis. Our analysis spotted STEM + C publication trends, popular topics and their dynamics over time. This work also pinpointed commonly used methodologies for integration study for both PK, K-12 and higher education. Meanwhile, several future research directions were identified. This work contributes to the literature by systematically examining the existing literature and bringing machine-learning-based data mining techniques to the analysis.
Unplugged activities in the elementary school mathematics classroom: The effects on students' computational thinking and mathematical creativity;"Hu, Linlin; Wang, Hao";2024;THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.tsc.2024.101653;;;;Yes;The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has led to the proliferation of computational thinking (CT) education. However, research on unplugged activities' influence in elementary math classrooms is limited, despite some exploring programming's cognitive benefits. This study presents both qualitative and quantitative analyzes stemming from a ten-week quasi- experimental research endeavor, specifically tailored for third-grade students. The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students' mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46). The results indicated that unplugged activities exhibited significant advantages in fostering students' CT and mathematical creativity across three dimensions, namely, problem- posing creativity (t = 5.830, p < 0.01), problem-solving creativity (t = 6.633, p < 0.01), and creative self-efficacy (t t = 7.554, p < 0.01). Furthermore, the study revealed a relationship between students' mathematical creativity as a predictor of CT. The results of the quantitative analysis were supported by the teacher's and students' interview data, and the students felt excited and interested in the unplugged activities, whereas some students using the lecture-based method Reported boredom and lack of interactivity. This research offered valuable insights for mathematics and CT education practice, underscoring unplugged activity as an innovative instructional approach that brings forth new possibilities for traditional mathematics teaching, with potential applications in the K-12 curriculum.
A systematic review of the literature regarding socially assistive robots in pre-tertiary education;"Papadopoulos, Irena; Lazzarino, Runa; Miah, Syed; Weaver, Tim; Thomas, Bernadette; Koulouglioti, Christina";2020;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;Review;WoS;10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103924;;;Yes;Yes;With rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade, schools have increasingly employed innovative tools, intelligent applications and methods that are changing the education system with the aim of improving both user experience and learning gain in the classrooms. Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synThesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored.
EAGER: Collaborative Research: Building Capacity for K-12 Artificial Intelligence Education Research;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial intelligence (AI) will profoundly impact society in the US and around the globe. It is beginning to permeate every aspect of our daily lives and is fundamentally reshaping our workforce. Because AI will dramatically impact both the economy and national security, it is imperative that we develop a thoughtful national response to this phenomenally disruptive technology. This response must include a meaningful approach to introducing K-12 students to AI. However, despite the accelerating pace of AI technology development both in the US and abroad and the rapidly growing interest in a strategy for K-12 AI education, there is no research foundation on which such a strategy can be readily based. It is therefore essential to develop an evidence-based approach for K-12 AI education, which calls for a concerted capacity building effort within the education research community to address this significant need. The objective of the project is to begin building an interdisciplinary research community to address the critical challenge of creating a national K-12 AI education strategy by convening two interdisciplinary workshops. This project is funded by the STEM + Computing (STEM+C) program, which supports research and development to understand the integration of computing and computational thinking in STEM learning. The project will bring together experts in education research, AI, industry, and K-12 educational practitioners to develop a shared understanding and create a research agenda to bring evidence-based AI education to K-12 classrooms. Education researchers will include leaders from AI in education, the learning sciences, STEM education (including science education, mathematics education, computer science education, and computational thinking), teacher education, and developmental psychology. The workshops will play a central role in establishing the connections that are essential to the success of a national K-12 AI education initiative. Collectively, leaders in these fields will create a research agenda for developing best practices for AI education for K-12 student populations. The project team will also conduct broad analyses of how K-12 AI education research should respond to AI's far-reaching societal impact. These analyses will both be informed by and will guide the workshops. The findings will be presented in Reports in publications prepared by the project team. Together, the workshop series and analyses hold significant transformative potential to address the urgent need to catalyze a research community that will guide curricular design and implementation for K-12 AI education. As a long-term objective, the project will be conducted to most effectively inform, shape, and define a national strategy for K-12 AI education. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

RAPID: Empowering Future Teachers with Generative AI Education: Understanding Applications, Risks, and Limits;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to reshape education and may change teaching practices in K-12. As such, teachers must prepare students to have the necessary skills that will allow them to learn about these tools and use them productively for their lives and education. This project will pilot a curriculum with new educational methods in preparing pre-service teachers in understanding the fundamentals of generative AI and its potential teaching applications. This includes helping them develop the critical thinking skills to effectively judge generative AI's limitations and affordances in relation to classroom implementation. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097), and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project will examine the impact of the piloting curriculum on developing pre-service teachers' competencies including knowledge, skills, and attitudes in using generative AI. The research will be guided by two research questions: 1) How does the implementation of the curriculum impact pre-service teachers' knowledge and attitudes to use generative AI tools to support classroom instruction?; 2) What role do pre-service teachers see for generative AI tools in supporting teaching and learning, including its limitations and risks? Using a mixed-methods approach, researchers will investigate whether and how pre-service teachers leverage generative AI tools in their own learning and preparation for future teaching. At the conclusion of the project, research findings and open-source curriculum materials will be widely disseminated for other teacher education faculty to adapt for their own coursework. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
RAPID: Artificial Intelligence Curriculum and K-12 Teacher Agency: Barriers and Opportunities;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;AI-powered tools have the potential to transform education, both in formal and informal settings. The immense potential for AI to address challenges in education has created an urgent need to characterize how K-12 education may leverage these powerful tools safely, ethically, and equitably. While the AI in education landscape is changing drastically and rapidly, little is known about K-12 educators' engagement with AI and how newly developed tools and curriculum will be received and integrated into classrooms. K-12 teachers are critical stakeholders whose understanding, opinions, and willingness to engage with AI tools will be important factors in the success of AI in K-12 education. Without fundamentally understanding K-12 teacher opinions and agency related to AI in education, there is risk of making investments in tools, training, and curricula that simply do not meet the needs or address the concerns of the teachers who will implement them. This project addresses this knowledge gap by collecting survey data from a national sample of K-12 teachers to guide the development of AI tools and curriculum. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097), and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Researchers will develop and refine a survey to be distributed to approximately 1,000 K-12 teachers nationally. The project investigates the overall research question: How do K-12 teachers perceive AI education and its impacts on the workforce? The project leverages an ecological agency model to develop the survey about AI tool and curriculum adoption. The survey will include both quantitative measures and open-response questions and will be refined through cognitive interviews and reviewed by an expert panel to ensure clarity and completeness. Research results will be disseminated in scholarly publications, as well as through venues that will reach educational practitioners and the public at large. The project results will have the potential to directly impact AI curriculum and tool development for K-12 education. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Self-construction and Interactive Simulations to Support the Learning of Drawing Graphs and Reasoning in Mathematics;"Palha, Sonia; Bouwer, Anders; Bredeweg, Bert; Keulen, Siard";2020;INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS (ITS 2020);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1007/978-3-030-49663-0_43;;;;Yes;In mathematics, sciences and economics, understanding and working with graphs are important skills. However, developing these skills has been shown to be a challenge in secondary and higher education as it involves high order thinking processes such as analysis, reflection and creativity. In this study, we present Interactive Virtual Math, a tool that supports the learning of a specific kind of graphs: dynamic graphs which represent the relation between at least two quantities that covary. The tool supports learners in visualizing abstract relations through enabling them to draw, move and modify graphs, and by combining graphs with other representations, especially interactive animations and textual explanations. This paper Reports a design experiment about students' learning graphs with this tool. Results show that students with difficulty in generating acceptable graphs improve their ability while working with the tool.

Learn with M.E.-Let Us Boost Personalized Learning in K-12 Math Education!;"Annus, Norbert; Kmet, Tibor";2024;EDUCATION SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/educsci14070773;;;;Yes;The traditional educational system, in certain aspects, limits personalized learning. This is mainly evident in the fact that average students, who do not have any learning difficulties, are required to solve the same tasks from the same textBook in the same order. Artificial intelligence and other smart learning tools present great opportunities for implementing a personalized learning system. Our previous surveys and literature reviews also show that educators see the greatest potential in personalized education for the assimilation of artificial intelligence into education. In this context, we have developed educational software called Learn with M.E. as Math Educator, which facilitates more personalized teaching of basic mathematical operations. This study presents the structure and operation of this application. We tested the usability of the software in several institutions. Our research target group consists of elementary school students, specifically those aged 11-15. This article provides a detailed overview of the accuracy and educational outcomes of the completed application. We evaluated the application and its effectiveness using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our research design combined elements of educational technology development and effectiveness assessment. To evaluate student performance, we employed a control group methodology. Data were analyzed by comparing test results between students using the software and those receiving traditional instruction. We examined user satisfaction through survey questionnaires. Teachers' opinions were gathered through structured interviews, and their responses were categorized using a SWOT analysis. The findings indicated that the use of the software significantly improved students' mathematics performance compared to the control group. Students provided positive feedback on the software's user interface, describing it as user-friendly and motivating. Teachers regarded the software as an effective educational tool, facilitating differentiated instruction and enhancing student engagement. The results suggest that digital educational tools, such as the developed software, can provide substantial added value in education.
Understanding Biological Evolution Through Computational Thinking a K-12 Learning Progression;"Christensen, Dana; Lombardi, Doug";2020;SCIENCE & EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1007/s11191-020-00141-7;;;;Yes;Computational thinking is a contemporary science and engineering practice that has been introduced to the US science classrooms due to its emphasis in theNext Generation Science Standards(NGSS). However, including computational thinking into science instruction may be challenging. Therefore, for biological evolution (an essential theory within biology that spans across temporal and organizational scales), we recommend integrating computational thinking into evolution teaching to overcome misconceptions, reinforce the nature of science (NOS), and allow student embodiment (as students become emerged in their models, i.e., personification). We present a learning progression, which outlines biological evolution learning coupled with computational thinking. The defined components of computational thinking (input, integration, output, and feedback) are integrated with biology student roles. The complex nature of both teaching computational thinking and biological evolution lends toward a learning progression that identifies instructional context, computational product, and computational process and spans from simple to complex. Two major themes of biological evolution, unity and diversity have each been paired with both computational thinking and specific corresponding NGSS standards at levels of increasing complexity. There are virtually no previous studies which relate computation and evolution across scales, which paves the way for questions of importance, support, benefits, and overall student achievement in relation to the advancement of science in education.
Problem-solving skill development through STEM learning approaches;"Zeeshan, Khaula; Watanabe, Chihiro; Neittaanmaki, Pekka";2021;2021 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE 2021);Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637226;;;;Yes;This research to practice full paper presents problem solving skill development through STEM learning approaches. There is a rapid growing interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. One reason for this ever growing interest is to develop the skills in pupils, which are required by the industry 4.0 (Artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of things) in an era of global digitization. One such skill is problem-solving skill. In this article, we present a brief overview of related studies and conceptions in the past related to STEM education, why STEM education is needed? What is problem-solving skill development in context of STEM education? This article aims to highlight that how STEM education can develop problem-solving skills in learners at primary education level through thinking, and creating solutions for real life problems.
Evaluating AI literacy of secondary students: Framework and scale development;"Zhong, Baichang; Liu, Xiaofan";2025;COMPUTERS & EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105230;;;;Yes;"K-12 AI education not only equips students with AI literacy but also encourages underrepresented groups to pursue further studies or careers in this field. Secondary students were particularly wellsuited for comprehensive AI education due to their cognitive characteristics and developmental readiness. While most studies have focused on developing pedagogy, curriculum, and tools for secondary AI education, they have prioritized measuring students' learning outcomes over literacy development. Referring to the empirical research on secondary AI education as well as Piaget's Epistemology and Bloom's Taxonomy, this study figured out a KAT framework that constitutes AI literacy: (1) AI Knowledge (AI fundamentals, elements of AI technology, application of AI technology), (2) AI Affectivity (AI and human, AI and society), and (3) AI Thinking (engineering design thinking, computational thinking). Based on this, a 57-item AI literacy scale (AILS) was developed, and 56 items were retained after expert judgement. Then, a large sample of Chinese secondary students was surveyed, resulting in 1392 valid samples, which were randomly divided into two sub-samples: 720 samples were used for item reduction through Rasch Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis; 672 samples were used for model validation and comparison through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicated the AILS with three-factor structure of 48 items has a good reliability and validity. Moreover, gender differences in AI literacy among secondary students were examined.

The implications, limitations and future research were also discussed."
Seeking Synergy: K-12 Professional Development as a Model for College Science Faculty;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"It is a national priority to produce a well-prepared workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). This workforce is needed to make progress in science, to advance national health initiatives, and support overall national prosperity in an increasingly technical economy. One contemporary challenge colleges and universities face in meeting this challenge is the need to provide effective professional development opportunities for faculty members. For example, professional development could help faculty learn about emerging research related to student learning, and this knowledge could inform teaching practices. This project aims to serve the national interest by convening professional development leaders from both K-12 and higher education to determine the design principles of a new model of professional development for college science teaching. This project is designed to draw upon evidence-based, effective professional development practices from the K-12 sector, and to apply these strategies to programs for faculty members teaching undergraduate biology students. Multiple K-12 models for professional development have been rigorously tested and shown to improve teacher knowledge, skill, and student learning. This gathering is designed to focus specifically on teaching and learning methods designed to reveal and respond to student thinking. This project will support a three-day conference to define the design principles of a new professional development program for college biology faculty. The model will derive components from K-12 professional development models and focus on helping faculty learn the pedagogy of revealing and responding to student thinking. The conference will extend the work of two well-established research and professional development groups in STEM education, the Automated Analysis of Constructed Response project (AACR) and the Science Teachers Learning from Lesson Analysis project (STeLLA). AACR focuses on undergraduate science education and addresses: the creation of constructed-response assessments that reveal students' mental models of scientific concepts; the creation of machine learning models to predict experts' scoring of student responses; the production of Reports for faculty that describe the computerized analysis of student writing; and long-term, local faculty learning communities that support faculty users of AACR. STeLLA supports K-12 teachers to view their teaching through the lens of student thinking. The efficacy of STeLLA's approach to professional development has been demonstrated through randomized and quasi-experimental studies that link teacher learning with increased student learning. The conference will include members of AACR and STeLLA as well as experts from other higher education and K-12 professional development arenas. The conference will produce a framework for developing a new college biology professional development program, which can be implemented and researched. It also will create a network of science education professional development specialists and researchers from both K-12 and higher education. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multimodal Technologies in Precision Education: Providing New Opportunities or Adding More Challenges?;"Bin Qushem, Umar; Christopoulos, Athanasios; Oyelere, Solomon Sunday; Ogata, Hiroaki; Laakso, Mikko-Jussi";2021;EDUCATION SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/educsci11070338;;;;Yes;Personalized or precision education (PE) considers the integration of multimodal technologies to tailor individuals' learning experiences based on their preferences and needs. To identify the impact that emerging multimodal technologies have on personalized education, we reviewed recent implementations and applications of systems (e.g., MOOCs, serious games, artificial intelligence, learning management systems, mobile applications, augmented/virtual reality, classroom technologies) that integrate such features. Our findings revealed that PE techniques could leverage the instructional potential of educational platforms and tools by facilitating students' knowledge acquisition and skill development. The added value of PE is also extended beyond the online digital learning context, as positive outcomes were also identified in blended/face-to-face learning scenarios, with multiple connections being discussed between the impact of PE on student efficacy, achievement, and well-being. In line with the recommendations and suggestions that supporters of PE make, we provide implications for research and practice as well as ground for policy formulation and reformation on how multimodal technologies can be integrated into the educational context.
Effectiveness of tutoring at school: A machine learning evaluation;"Ballestar, Maria Teresa; Mir, Miguel Cuerdo; Pedrera, Luis Miguel Doncel; Sainz, Jorge";2024;TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.techfore.2023.123043;;;Yes;Yes;Tutoring programs are effective in reducing school failures among at-risk students. However, there is still room for improvement in maximising the social returns they provide on investments.Many factors and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on providing public administration with advanced decision-making tools.First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of the Programa para la Mejora de ' Exito Educativo (Programme for the Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla y Le ' on in Spain, in 2018-2019, the academic year previous to the pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO).Second, we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and explained how different factors and components affect student engagement and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol.
Deep Learning Discrete Calculus (DLDC): a family of discrete numerical methods by universal approximation for STEM education to frontier research;"Saha, Sourav; Park, Chanwook; Knapik, Stefan; Guo, Jiachen; Huang, Owen; Liu, Wing Kam";2023;COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS;Article;WoS;10.1007/s00466-023-02292-0;;;;Yes;The article proposes formulating and codifying a set of applied numerical methods, coined as Deep Learning Discrete Calculus (DLDC), that uses the knowledge from discrete numerical methods to interpret the deep learning algorithms through the lens of applied mathematics. The DLDC methods aim to leverage the flexibility and ever-increasing resources of deep learning and rich literature on numerical analysis to formulate a general class of numerical methods that can directly use data with uncertainty to predict the behavior of an unknown system as well as elevate the speed and accuracy of numerical solution of the governing equations for known systems. The article is structured into two major sections. In the first section, the building blocks of the DLDC methods are presented and deep learning structures analogous to traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element methods are constructed with a view to incorporate these techniques in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics syllabus for K-12 students. The second section builds upon the building blocks of the previous discussion and proposes new solution schemes for differential and integral equations pertinent to multiscale mechanics. Each section is accompanied by a mathematical formulation of the numerical methods, analogous DLDC formulation, and suitable examples.
An explainable machine learning approach for student dropout prediction;"Krueger, Joao Gabriel Correa; Britto Jr, Alceu de Souza; Barddal, Jean Paul";2023;EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120933;;;;Yes;School dropout is a relevant socio-economic problem across the globe. Predictive models have been developed to determine the likelihood of students dropping out of their studies precociously to overcome such a problem. Academic systems, which gather data from many students, are potential sources for datasets that feed dropout prediction algorithms, thus leading to general improvements in education quality. Despite successful past attempts to predict dropout, several works depict small datasets with features that are hard to reproduce. Furthermore, predicting whether a student will drop out is not enough to diagnose and prevent the problem as it is also necessary to provide potential justifications for the dropout. This paper proposes an approach for creating and enriching a dataset for dropout prediction, which has been applied for dropout prediction using data from 19 schools in Brazil. With this dataset and using classifiers and model explaining techniques, our experiments achieved Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR) scores of up to 89.5%, Precision up to 95%, Recall up to 93%, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) rates up to 97% when predicting dropout at different year moments. This study also shows differences when predicting dropouts in different educational stages, such as preschool and secondary education, with the former being more complex than the latter. In addition to the high recognition rates, our proposal identifies potential reasons for student dropout, which are relevant for educational institutions to take preemptive actions.
Action Research Report from a Multi-Year Approach to Teaching Artificial Intelligence at the K-6 Level;"Heinze, Clint; Haase, Janet; Higgins, Helen";2010;PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AAAI-10);Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;In Australia, the Scientists-in-Schools program partners professional scientists with teachers from K-12 schools to improve early engagement and educational outcomes in the sciences and mathematics.

Scaling High-Leverage Curriculum Scaffolding in Middle-School Mathematics;"Malik, Rizwaan; Abdi, Dorna; Wang, Rose; Demszky, Dorottya";2024;PROCEEDINGS OF THE ELEVENTH ACM CONFERENCE ON LEARNING@SCALE, L@S 2024;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1145/3657604.3664698;;;;Yes;Despite well-designed curriculum materials, teachers often face significant challenges in their implementation due to the diverse learning needs present in classrooms. This paper examines whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to enhance K-12 math education by facilitating the creation of high-quality curriculum scaffolds that reflect expert teachers' strategies. Through an in-depth qualitative analysis with experienced middle-school math teachers, we identified crucial instructional supplements such as warm-up tasks and example-problem pairs that are essential for engaging students and supporting diverse learner needs. Building on these insights, we developed ScaffGen, an LLM-powered tool designed to generate curriculum-aligned educational materials. While LLMs alone may fall short in educational contexts, when enhanced with expert teacher insights, they can effectively emulate the cognitive processes required for pedagogically robust material creation. We plan to assess the effectiveness of these AI-generated materials through rigorous evaluations involving comparisons with expert-written benchmarks and field tests in classroom settings. This research highlights the potential of LLMs to mimic expert decision-making in educational material creation, offering significant implications for scalable instructional support.
The effectiveness of a math game: The impact of integrating conceptual clarification as support;"Vandercruysse, Sylke; ter Vrugte, Judith; de Jong, Ton; Wouters, Pieter; van Oostendorp, Herre; Verschaffel, Lieven; Moeyaert, Mariola; Elen, Jan";2016;COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.chb.2016.06.004;;;;Yes;This study investigates the impact of integrating conceptual clarifications as support in an educational math game, and explores the impact of adding this (internal vs. external) support on students' game and mathematical performance, intrinsic motivation, and game perception. Three conditions are established: a condition in which internal support is offered, a condition in which (identical) external support is offered, and a control condition in which no support is added to the game. One hundred twenty-two vocational secondary education students participated in this study. The results of this study indicate that students benefit from playing with an educational game in order to enhance their proportional reasoning skills. Adding conceptual clarifications as instructional support in an intrinsically integrated game is not recommended. If the support is given to the students anyhow, it is advised to offer it externally because internally integrating this support leads to a decrease in performance and motivation. Hence, not only support as such, but also the way it is integrated in the game-based learning process, might be decisive for its effectivity. Obviously, further research is warranted in order to replicate these findings also for other types of support, other game-based learning environments and other target groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel Feature-Based Difficulty Prediction Method for Mathematics Items Using XGBoost-Based SHAP Model;"Yi, Xifan; Sun, Jianing; Wu, Xiaopeng";2024;MATHEMATICS;Article;WoS;10.3390/math12101455;;;Yes;Yes;The level of difficulty of mathematical test items is a critical aspect for evaluating test quality and educational outcomes. Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China's Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the black box nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students' learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice.
A data mining approach to classifying e-learning satisfaction of higher education students: a Philippine case;"Go, Marivel B.; Golbin, Rodolfo A., Jr.; Velos, Severina P.; Dayupay, Johnry P.; Cababat, Feliciana G.; Baird, Jeem Clyde C.; Quinanola, Hazna";2023;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND LEARNING;Article;WoS;10.1504/IJIL.2023.130103;;;;Yes;"E-learning has become increasingly important for higher education institutions. It offers an alternative mode of learning for educational institutions during critical situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While e-learning has gained growing attention in the current literature, a significant gap is left unaddressed for emerging economies, particularly the Philippines. In this paper, the factors of e-learning in a higher education institution in the Philippines are analysed. A data mining approach is used to predict the satisfaction of higher education students given eleven features of the subjects. Four classifiers: 1) logistic regression; 2) support vector machine; 3) multilayer perceptron; 4) decision tree, are used to develop the predictive models. The findings reveal that the features considered in this paper can be used to accurately predict the student satisfaction towards e-learning of higher education students in the Philippines."
AI-based adaptive personalized content presentation and exercises navigation for an effective and engaging E-learning platform;"Sayed, Wafaa S.; Noeman, Ahmed M.; Abdellatif, Abdelrahman; Abdelrazek, Moemen; Badawy, Mostafa G.; Hamed, Ahmed; El-Tantawy, Samah";2023;MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.1007/s11042-022-13076-8;;;;Yes;Effective and engaging E-learning becomes necessary in unusual conditions such as COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the early stages of K-12 education. This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed.
The Effect of AI-Based Systems on Mathematics Achievement in Rural Context: A Quantitative Study;"Khazanchi, Rashmi; Di Mitri, Daniele; Drachsler, Hendrik";2025;JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING;Article;WoS;10.1111/jcal.13098;Yes;;Yes;Yes;BackgroundDespite educational advances, poor mathematics achievement persists among K-12 students, particularly in rural areas with limited resources and skilled teachers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States.MethodsThis study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA.Results and ConclusionsThe findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups.ImplicationsThe findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings.
Automating Feedback to Improve Teachers’ Effective Use of Instructional Discourse in K-12 Mathematics Classrooms;Suresh, Abhijit;2022;;Dissertation/Thesis;WoS;;;;;Yes;
Automating Transfer Credit Assessment-A Natural Language Processing-Based Approach;"Chandrasekaran, Dhivya; Mago, Vijay";2022;CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA;Article;WoS;10.32604/cmc.2022.027236;;;;Yes;Student mobility or academic mobility involves students moving between institutions during their post-secondary education, and one of the challenging tasks in this process is to assess the transfer credits to be offered to the incoming student. In general, this process involves domain experts comparing the learning outcomes of the courses, to decide on offering transfer credits to the incoming students. This manual implementation is not only labor-intensive but also influenced by undue bias and administrative complexity. The proposed research article focuses on identifying a model that exploits the advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to effectively automate this process. Given the unique structure, domain specificity, and complexity of learning outcomes (LOs), a need for designing a tailor-made model arises. The proposed model uses a clustering-inspired methodology based on knowledge-based semantic similarity measures to assess the taxonomic similarity of LOs and a transformer-based semantic similarity model to assess the semantic similarity of the LOs. The similarity between LOs is further aggregated to form course to course similarity. Due to the lack of quality benchmark datasets, a new benchmark dataset containing seven course-to-course similarity measures is proposed. Understanding the inherent need for flexibility in the decision-making process the aggregation part of the model offers tunable parameters to accommodate different levels of leniency. While providing an efficient model to assess the similarity between courses with existing resources, this research work also steers future research attempts to apply NLP in the field of articulation in an ideal direction by highlighting the persisting research gaps.
How Gamification Applies for Educational Purpose Specially with College Algebra;"Faghihi, Usef; Brautigam, Albert; Jorgenson, Kris; Martin, David; Brown, Angela; Measures, Elizabeth; Maldonado-Bouchard, Sioui";2014;5TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURES, 2014 BICA;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1016/j.procs.2014.11.102;;;;Yes;"Gaming environments have been used to teach mathematical topics such as addition and division in a fun manner*. However, when it comes to college level mathematical concepts such as the use of the quadratic formula, there are very few software that explain these concepts in a fun way. In this paper, we present a first step towards using video game elements and Artificial Intelligence Tutoring system techniques to teach mathematical concepts such as factoring and the quadratic formula. These concepts are explained in a way that helps learners make a connection between the mathematical concepts and their real life experience. These methods of learning are supported by several studies (Bonwell & Eison, 1991; Donovan & Bransford, 2004; Scarlatos, 2006). We use gamification techniques during the training and test phases to help students learn the mathematical concepts. We then compare the performance of students who used our system (MathDungeon) with that of students who used the most popular math tutoring programs used in US colleges: Assessment and Learning, K-12, Higher Education (ALEKS). The number of students who used MathDungeon and scored above the median score on the test of math performance was greater than the number of students who used ALEKS and scored higher than the median score."
Collaborative Research: INK-12: Teaching and Learning Using Interactive Ink Inscriptions in K-12;;2010;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The research project continues a collaboration between MIT's Center for Educational Computing Initiatives and TERC focusing on the enhancement of K-12 STEM math and science education by means of technology that supports (1) creation of what are termed ink inscriptions--handwritten sketches, graphs, maps, notes, etc. made on a computer using a pen-based interface, and (2) in-class communication of ink inscriptions via a set of connected wireless tablet computers. The project builds on the PIs' prior work, which demonstrated that both teachers and students benefit from such technology because they can easily draw and write on a tablet screens, thus using representations not possible with only a typical keyboard and mouse; and they can easily send such ink inscriptions to one another via wireless connectivity. This communication provides teachers the opportunity to view all the students' work and make decisions about which to share anonymously on a public classroom screen or on every student's screen in order to support discussion in a conversation-based classroom. Artificial intelligence methods are used to analyze ink inscriptions in order to facilitate selection and discussion of student work. The project is a series of design experiments beginning with the software that emerged from earlier exploratory work. The PIs conduct two cycles of experiments to examine how tablets affect students learning in 4th and 5th grade mathematics and science. The project research questions and methods focus on systematic monitoring of teachers' and students' responses to the innovation in order to inform the development process. The PIs collect data on teachers' and students' use of the technology and on student learning outcomes and use those data as empirical evidence about the promise of the technology for improving STEM education in K-12 schools. An external evaluator uses parallel data collection, conducting many of the same research activities as the core team and independently providing analysis to be correlated with other data. His involvement is continuous and provides formative evaluation Reports to the project through conferences, site visits, and conference calls. The primary products are substantiated research findings on the use of tablet computers, inscriptions, and networks in 4th and 5 grade classrooms. In addition the PIs develop models for teacher education and use, and demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence techniques in facilitating use of the technology.

Collaborative Research: INK-12: Teaching and Learning Using Interactive Ink Inscriptions in K-12;;2010;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The research project continues a collaboration between MIT's Center for Educational Computing Initiatives and TERC focusing on the enhancement of K-12 STEM math and science education by means of technology that supports (1) creation of what are termed ink inscriptions--handwritten sketches, graphs, maps, notes, etc. made on a computer using a pen-based interface, and (2) in-class communication of ink inscriptions via a set of connected wireless tablet computers. The project builds on the PIs' prior work, which demonstrated that both teachers and students benefit from such technology because they can easily draw and write on a tablet screens, thus using representations not possible with only a typical keyboard and mouse; and they can easily send such ink inscriptions to one another via wireless connectivity. This communication provides teachers the opportunity to view all the students' work and make decisions about which to share anonymously on a public classroom screen or on every student's screen in order to support discussion in a conversation-based classroom. Artificial intelligence methods are used to analyze ink inscriptions in order to facilitate selection and discussion of student work. The project is a series of design experiments beginning with the software that emerged from earlier exploratory work. The PIs conduct two cycles of experiments to examine how tablets affect students learning in 4th and 5th grade mathematics and science. The project research questions and methods focus on systematic monitoring of teachers' and students' responses to the innovation in order to inform the development process. The PIs collect data on teachers' and students' use of the technology and on student learning outcomes and use those data as empirical evidence about the promise of the technology for improving STEM education in K-12 schools. An external evaluator uses parallel data collection, conducting many of the same research activities as the core team and independently providing analysis to be correlated with other data. His involvement is continuous and provides formative evaluation Reports to the project through conferences, site visits, and conference calls. The primary products are substantiated research findings on the use of tablet computers, inscriptions, and networks in 4th and 5 grade classrooms. In addition the PIs develop models for teacher education and use, and demonstrate the utility of artificial intelligence techniques in facilitating use of the technology. With the addition of Malden Public Schools to the list of participating districts, which includes Cambridge Public Schools and Waltham Public Schools from earlier work, the project expands the field test sites to up 20 schools' classrooms."

Although efforts are beginning to incorporate AI learning within K-12 education, there is little research exploring how to introduce students to AI and how to support teachers to integrate AI learning experiences in their classrooms. This is especially true at the elementary school level. A particularly promising approach for providing effective and engaging AI learning experiences for elementary students is game-based learning. In this paper, we explore how to introduce AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning into upper elementary school (student ages 8 to 11) using game-based learning. To ground the work in the realities of elementary school classrooms, we present insights from interviews with elementary school teachers to understand how best to support them in integrating AI into their classrooms. We then present the design of PRimARvAI, a game-based learning environment that supports rich problem-based learning activities within upper elementary classrooms centered on AI applied toward solving life-science problems. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing AI -infused collaborative inquiry learning to upper elementary students.

RAPID: DRL AI: Unlocking the Potential of Generative AI for Equity and Access in Robotics Education;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;In the context of educational robotics, this RAPID project examines the educational equity potential of a task-oriented generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool to assist with creative productivity tasks in engineering design. This time-sensitive project will investigate how to support lower-performing learners through development and testing of an AI robot design assistant in a virtual robot-building game. Research will evaluate the design and implementation of the task-oriented generative AI tool and test the potential of generative AI assistance to close the equity gap in this specific context. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The prototype system development and design-based research approach will explore the initial technical design space and uncover and define what are the more challenging problems for future research based on the prototype task-assistive AI tool. Outcomes include a platform for future research that could reach over 500,000 K-12 students, educators, and policymakers in its first year. A crossover-design classroom study will assess task performance and motivational effects of the tool, testing for greater impact among learners with lower prior robotics experience, as well as peripheral effects such as poor subsequent performance in the absence of the tool. Results will inform field-wide efforts to develop AI tools for advancing age-appropriate equitable learning, supporting interest in AI, and integrating generative AI in education in an ethical, responsible, and effective way. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Early detection of university students with potential difficulties;"Hoffait, Anne-Sophie; Schyns, Michael";2017;DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.dss.2017.05.003;;;;Yes;Using data mining methods, this paper presents a new means of identifying freshmen's profiles likely to face major difficulties to complete their first academic year. Academic failure is a relevant issue at a time when post-secondary education is ever more critical to economic success. We aim at early detection of potential failure using student data available at registration, i.e. school records and environmental factors, with a view to timely and efficient remediation and/or study reorientation. We adapt three data mining methods, namely random forest, logistic regression and artificial neural network algorithms. We design algorithms to increase the accuracy of the prediction when some classes are of major interest. These algorithms are context independent and can be used in different fields. Real data pertaining to undergraduates at the University of Liege (Belgium), illustrates our methodology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
Combining Multimodal Analyses of Students' Emotional and Cognitive States to Understand Their Learning Behaviors;"Ashwin, T. S.; Snyder, Caitlin; Akpanoko, Celestine E.; Srigowri, M. P.; Biswas, Gautam";2024;32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, ICCE 2024, VOL I;Proceedings Paper;WoS;;;;;Yes;The incorporation of technology into primary and secondary education has facilitated the creation of curricula that utilize computational tools for problem- solving. In Open-Ended Learning Environments (OELEs), students participate in learning-by-modeling activities that enhance their understanding of (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) STEM and computational concepts. This research presents an innovative multimodal emotion recognition approach that analyzes facial expressions and speech data to identify pertinent learning-centered emotions, such as engagement, delight, confusion, frustration, and boredom. Utilizing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, including High-Speed Face Emotion Recognition (HSEmotion) model for visual data and wav2vec 2.0 for auditory data, our method is refined with a modality verification step and a fusion layer for accurate emotion classification. The multimodal technique significantly increases emotion detection accuracy, with an overall accuracy of 87%, and an F1-score of 84%. The study also correlates these emotions with model building strategies in collaborative settings, with statistical analyses indicating distinct emotional patterns associated with effective and ineffective strategy use for tasks model construction and debugging tasks. These findings underscore the role of adaptive learning environments in fostering students' emotional and cognitive development.

ChatGPT, Finances, and Degree Attainment: Increasing Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Utilization and Implications for Students' Decision-Making;Fletcher, Trina;2024;2024 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE, FIE;Proceedings Paper;WoS;10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892857;;Yes;Yes;Yes;Students' decision-making related to attending college for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees and retaining them within those fields continue to be of focus, especially when considering the national goal of satisfying industry, private, and public sector workforce needs. This is particularly important when considering growing national security concerns and ongoing high cybersecurity and climate change workforce demands. However, despite concerted efforts, low enrollment and student attrition continue to be a challenge, even more so since the onset of the global pandemic.Simultaneously, the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has seen a sharp increase since 2022 by various stakeholders, most notably college students. Additionally, faculty are encouraged by their higher education institutions to incorporate these tools within classrooms for several reasons, including demands from industry for students to gain knowledge and experience with generative AI tools.Given the importance of understanding the ongoing issue of STEM degree attrition and the increasing utilization of generative AI, this research study explored these two areas using ChatGPT, one of the world's most utilized generative AI language models, within the process. The first research question (RQ#1) is: What is the top reason why students do not finish college? The response provided solely emphasized finances and/or financial constraints. Based on that answer, the second research question (RQ #2) was: Is getting a college degree worth the cost? RQ #2 was explored to allow a deeper understanding of the initial research question from a different angle. Both questions were analyzed through the lens of two theoretical frameworks, the human capital theory and the principal-agent theory, and results were compared to the literature as a form of research validation.This research study is essential as there is an ongoing increase in the utilization of generative AI in homes, K-12 institutions, and higher education for everyday knowledge, formal and informal education. When considering that soon-to-be and current college students may be using these generative AI tools to make decisions related to pursuing and/or retaining their educational status, it is essential to explore how generative AI system outputs align with what has been researched and documented in the literature. Therefore, this research study explored the application of ChatGPT and the system's responses to research questions as a form of document analysis and analyzed those results using triangulation as a form of validation. The analysis and results of this study contributed directly to the recommendations and feedback to the owners of ChatGPT - OpenAI. Additionally, the results highlighted a need for increased focus on AI ethics related to data input, data output, access to the system, and who has a seat at the table as the company recommends, approves, and implements changes. Limitations of this study are provided along with an overarching concluding statement.
RAPID: Exploring an AI Literacies Framework for Young Children: A Delphi Study;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming society, and it is becoming increasingly clear to educators and researchers that K-12 students must be prepared for an AI-driven future. One crucial area that requires research is early childhood education (ECE) for children aged 5 to 8 years old. The potential impact of AI on early childhood cannot be overstated: there are far-reaching implications for language development, cognitive skills, sensory perception, and social-emotional development, which are the holistic goals of ECE. Prior research suggests that exposing young children to AI is feasible and can have positive effects on their AI knowledge and skills. These studies often focus exclusively on how children learn with and about AI, without fully considering the holistic goals and practices of ECE. There is an urgent need to address such issues in ECE AI education and ensure early AI learning is appropriate, effective, and equitable. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. This project will develop an interdisciplinary framework for ECE AI learning by using the Delphi methodology, an iterative process of converging expert opinions on emerging topics. A panel of 30 experts of diverse and inclusive representation from three fields: AI, Child Development and Early Education, and Child-Computer Interaction will be recruited. These experts will explore three fundamental questions across cognitive, situated, and critical framing of AI. (1) What: What are the most appropriate AI learning goals and content for young children? (2) Who: What developmental advantages/constraints and equity concerns must be considered for AI learning? and (3) How: How can we introduce AI effectively and equitably? The research process involves three iterative rounds of discussion, survey, and review of materials prepared and synthesized by the research team. By articulating the underlying concepts and principles of AI literacies in ECE through cognitive, situated, and critical framing and from multidisciplinary perspectives, the resulting framework will help advance our understanding of how young children can develop knowledge and skills related to AI and inform future endeavors in this area, with particular attention to individuals with special needs and cultural relevance to marginalized and underserved communities. The outcome of the project also has the potential to guide the development of age-appropriate curricula and pedagogy for young children as well as provide a basis for assessing and evaluating AI literacies in young children.

RAPID: DRL AI: Scaffolding Automated Feedback for Teachers;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;While Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve both science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teaching practice and students' overall classroom experiences, it is critical to better understand how teachers can more easily adapt it within their classrooms. In particular, supporting AI-driven tool adoption in resource-poor schools is crucial to address educational inequities. This RAPID project addresses an urgent need to facilitate integration of AI technologies into schools to maximize benefits while reducing the burden on teachers??? time. Specifically, the goal of this project is to understand how instructional coaches can implement AI teacher feedback tools, leveraging the advantages of such tools (cost effectiveness, scalability, customizability, data-based and privacy) and mitigating technical and time barriers to adoption. The findings and products of this project will support professional learning organizations as well as district-based coaches and teachers interested in automated feedback, and has the potential to significantly increase the quality of instruction at various types of institutions. The time-sensitive research will involve interviewing highly-skilled coaches to develop scaffolding resources by leveraging existing collaborations with two teacher professional learning programs. Working with coaches and teachers who serve grade 4-8 math classrooms with a large percentage of marginalized students, the project will design generalizable coaching cycles and conversational routines that take advantage of information from automated feedback, while designing for different coaching models, different coaching contexts, and teachers with varying aptitudes for technology. The study incorporates an interview phase, a design phase for coaching cycles and routines, and a pilot phase, with room for iteration and emphasis on dissemination of the findings. Overall, the study will provide insights into how AI-driven feedback can be integrated into teacher coaching, contributing to knowledge about the challenges and opportunities of implementing AI within existing instructional processes. Ultimately, this project will help uncover how AI can be harnessed to enhance teacher effectiveness and student learning in real-world educational settings in a scalable way.

AI-based Assessment in STEM Education Conference;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The Framework for K-12 Science Education has set forth an ambitious vision for science learning by integrating disciplinary science ideas, scientific and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts, so that students could develop competence to meet the STEM challenges of the 21st century. Achieving this vision requires transformation of assessment practices from relying on multiple-choice items to performance-based knowledge-in-use tasks. Such novel assessment tasks serve the purpose of both engaging students in using knowledge to solve problems and tracking students??? learning progression so that teachers could adjust instruction to meet students??? needs. However, these performance-based constructed-response items often prohibit timely feedback, which, in turn, has hindered science teachers from using these assessments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated great potential to meet this assessment challenge. To tackle this challenge, experts in assessment, AI, and science education will gather for a two-day conference at University of Georgia to generate knowledge of integrating AI in science assessment. The conference is organized around four themes: (a) AI and Domain Specific Learning Theory; (b) AI and validity theory and assessment design principles; (c) AI and technology integration theory; and (d) AI and pedagogical theory focusing on assessment practices. It allows participants to share theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, as well as research experiences. It can also help identify challenges and future research directions to increase the broad use of AI-based assessments in science education. The conference will be open to other researchers, postdocs, and students via Zoom. It is expected that conference participants establish a network in this emergent area of science assessment. Another outcome of the conference, Applying AI in STEM Assessment, will be published as an edited volume by Harvard Education Press. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.

Integrating AI Machine Learning into the Teaching of Paleontology Using Fossil Shark Teeth in Middle Schools;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Sharks have ruled the Earth???s oceans for 400 million years, leaving behind a widespread fossil record. Inspired by the extinct 65-foot-long predator Megalodon, fossil shark teeth can spark student interest and curiosity in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Machine Learning (ML), a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is used in a variety of fields today and is broadly applicable for developing predictive models that drive research and development. This project will integrate the previously separate domains of paleontology and computer science via ML. Middle school students will develop ML models to classify shark teeth by their form and function to test authentic research questions. Students will learn fundamental concepts about ML, increase awareness of 21st century careers, and gain access to diverse scientist role models. The project will document and address misconceptions about fossil sharks, paleontology, and ML. Focused on middle school teaching and learning in urban and rural Title I schools throughout Florida, the project team aims to address educational disparities in STEM to encourage students from underrepresented groups to consider the sciences and computational technology as a career path. The Scientist in Every Florida School infrastructure will facilitate recruitment, mentoring, and best practices, such as ensuring that the science and ML content is integrated into the scope and sequence of existing curricula. Additionally, participants will have access to thousands of digital fossil shark specimens in museum and global biodiversity databases. This project will advance the progress of science and promote innovative learning. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The researchers will investigate a set of interrelated questions focused on how middle schoolers and their teachers learn about ML, including: (1) What instructional components promote effective and feasible integrated learning of science, computational thinking, and ML? (2) What are teachers' perspectives on the value and usability of the new curriculum in their classrooms? (3) What learning scaffolds are needed, and to what extent will students learn AI knowledge? (4) How do misconceptions impact students' and teachers' comprehension of AI and science? (5) How does the curriculum impact interest, self-efficacy, and identity in science and 21st-century careers? A total of 76 teachers will be recruited within three successive year-long cohorts. Each year, the teachers will participate in professional development to acquire the necessary disciplinary knowledge and skills to co-develop curricula along with scientists and then implement the activities in their classrooms. Teachers will partner with scientists and join a large growing learning community, with over 1,000 teachers and 750 scientists statewide. Scientists will conduct visits to classrooms, either virtually or in-person, to facilitate curriculum implementation and provide personal examples of role models. Middle school teachers will be recruited primarily from Title I schools throughout Florida. Project data will be collected and analyzed using mixed methods including surveys, interviews, observations, knowledge tests, projects, and focus groups. This project will provide an innovative and under-explored context for advancing understanding of STEM integration with an emphasis on student and teacher learning about ML as they engage in paleontology investigations. The goal is to serve as a generalizable model for engaging students in K-12 AI education and enhancing students??? understanding and interest in relevant careers. Deliverables will include annual professional development for the teachers, year-round scientist classroom visits, vetted curricula and lesson plans that will be freely shared and promoted online, presentations at professional conferences, and research articles published in peer-reviewed literature.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model-Based Explainable Recommender;"Takami, Kyosuke; Flanagan, Brendan; Dai, Yiling; Ogata, Hiroaki";2024;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.4018/IJDET.337600;;;;Yes;Explainable recommendation, which provides an explanation about why a quiz is recommended, helps to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, little research examined the effectiveness of the explainable recommender, especially on academic performance. To survey its effectiveness, the authors evaluate the math academic performance among middle school students (n=115) by giving pre- and post-test questions based evaluation techniques. During the pre- and post-test periods, students were encouraged to use the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model based explainable recommendation system. To evaluate how well the students were able to do what they could not do, the authors defined growth rate and found recommended quiz clicked counts had a positive effect on the total number of solved quizzes (R=0.343, P=0.005) and growth rate (R=0.297, P=0.017) despite no correlation between the total number of solved quizzes and growth rate. The results suggest that the use of an explainable recommendation system that learns efficiently will enable students to do what they could not do before.
RAPID: DRL AI: A Community-Inclusive AI Chatbot to Support Teachers in Developing Culturally Focused and Universally Designed STEM Activities;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Large language models (LLM) represent a new and rapidly changing technological advancement for K12 STEM learning. It is critical at this point in time to investigate and provide pathways for including justice, equity, inclusion, and community cultural capital and wealth in designing LLM-based educational systems. In the context of developing an AI chatbot, this RAPID project will research the ways in which teachers can plan universally designed and culturally relevant and responsive K12 STEM learning activities and environments. This research will contribute to an improved LLM that will incorporate novel methods to incorporate community data and reinforce knowledge from user communities into the LLM that is largely missing from large text corpora on which LLMs are usually trained. The AI chatbot will increase teacher capacity to create more inclusive STEM activities and support career pathways by facilitating the inclusion of more underrepresented learners in STEM careers. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project will convene a series of focus groups to elicit training data for the chatbot, adopting a community-based participatory action research approach. This approach recognizes that AI can foster and grow community well-being by including the community in the design, orienting the AI to address community issues, and adopting an interdisciplinary and systems-based stance. The AI training will be sensitive to cultural nuances and techniques like sentiment analysis will help to understand the context and ensure culturally appropriate responses. Human-centered AI methods will be used to continuously incorporate user feedback by deploying the chatbot and actively seek responses from the diverse set of participants. This process will reinforce knowledge from user communities that is largely missing from content on which AIs are typically trained, producing an AI system that will generate more culturally aware text. Importantly, the project will create a model for developing community sourced AI LLMs that can continue to be refined and researched. A beta-level chatbot will be made available for teachers to improve their lesson plans, activity structures, and learning environments by the end of the project year for further research and development.

CAREER: Spatial Awareness for Machine Perception;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;For many applications in health, security, and robotics, the capability for computers to track objects in video is critical. From autonomous vehicles that reliably avoid obstacles to security cameras that swiftly respond during emergencies, artificial perception systems need to remain accurate during poor visibility situations, such as with cluttered rooms, dark streets, or occluded objects. This integrated research and education project aims to develop machines that are able to spatially sense their visual surroundings, even when the surroundings have low visibility with significant obstructions. On multiple levels, the investigators will furthermore use their integrated approach to advance education in artificial intelligence, such as outreach activities for K-12 students and streamlined curriculums for both undergraduate and graduate education in computer vision. The research program introduces a framework that tightly integrates geometry, motion, and acoustics in order to learn rich spatial representations of natural scenes from unlabeled visual data. The research team will study how learning from the incidental structures of unlabeled videos will cause rich spatial representations to emerge without human supervision. The framework will leverage the propagation of sound through objects to learn visual tracking under occlusion. In other cases, the project will use scene geometry to transfer incidental supervision between camera views in order to learn spatial memory models. A key advantage of the approach is the efficiency to operate on videos that span both large physical spaces and long temporal horizons. Motivated by implicit surfaces in mathematics and graphics, the algorithm will analytically represents videos as continuous functions, which are compact and robustly embed video dynamics in 3D space.

CAREER: Learning Design Representations: The Effect of Differential Geometric Manifolds on the Inference of Design Structure;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant will answer the following question: When (or under what conditions) does incorporating and merging multiple, known differential geometric manifolds into a learning algorithm significantly improve the sample efficiency of learning a design representation, given data? Finding useful mathematical representations of designed products and systems is one of the field's long-standing, fundamental, open research problems. It affects almost every major design task, whether that be optimization, understanding decision making and preferences, manufacturing planning, uncertainty quantification, or studying design cognition, behavior, or creativity, among others. But finding useful representations is difficult, because they must concurrently describe multiple mathematical structures, whose types vary across a design's shape, behavior, and function. If successful, such learned design representations can: (1) accelerate technological and economic competitiveness — e.g., by improving optimization convergence — (2) enable uncertainty quantification for more complex systems than presently possible — e.g., in systems with chaotic dynamics like Large Eddy Simulation; and (3) permit fast, accurate manufacturing analysis, computer geometry queries, and design synThesis — e.g., by providing compact search spaces for analysis algorithms. By combining advances across three novel mathematical areas -- Differential Geometry, Statistics, and Machine Learning (ML) — with Engineering Design, the work will advance the science behind how to infer underlying mathematical representations for complex systems, e.g., by enabling existing design methods to extend from single Euclidean representations to general Differential Geometry. Unlike past approaches to design representation, this approach of using both differential geometry and ML enables the research to answer fundamental questions regarding the practical limits of what is learnable about a system's design in finite samples when multiple, diverse types of representation are needed — the generated knowledge will answer related questions that arise across other scientific fields. Education and outreach will include: (1) a set of graduate summer programs that experiment with an unconventional part-workshop, part-summer school format for helping translate key results from new areas of mathematics into Engineering Design; (2) open-source, research and teaching infrastructure for broadening access to topics at the intersection of Design and Machine Learning; and (3) cross-cutting education and outreach activities that focus on increasing industrial relevance and participation of underrepresented groups in research and education at the college and K-12 level. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
SBIR Phase I: A Novel Experiential Learning Toy Teaching Robotics and Automation to K-12 Students;;2016;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This SBIR Phase I project is to raise awareness and enthusiasm for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education among young children through experiential learning enabled by novel and interactive robotic toys. U.S. Department of Labor's recent survey Reports that only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in science and engineering fields, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of the sustained economic expansion. Over the past few decades the U.S. contribution to the number of scientists and engineers worldwide has reduced from 40% to 15%. Interestingly, there is a high interest among young students for the STEM fields but approximately 40% of them end up switching to non-STEM careers by the time they graduate from college - according to the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. This project brings a radical change in this trend by aptly stimulating the curiosity and challenging the intelligence, the key catalysts for continued interest, in K-12 students. Through innovative and intelligent hardware and software modules, this project delivers an enhanced learning experience on next generation robotics and automation technologies in the classroom as well as at home, leading towards a much richer and secure prospect for the future tax payers. This SBIR Phase I project develops an interactive and reconfigurable robotics-learning system comprised of smart positioning modules and interconnects. The key innovations include: a zero nuts-and-bolts architecture for quick and easy system setup, distributed artificial intelligence for interactive plug-n-play operations, and personalized gaming and learning feature to engage different age groups, experience levels, and study areas. This gaming and learning system aids in understanding various concepts of new age manufacturing, shaped by rapidly evolving economic constraints, including but not limited to: challenges in flexible/lean manufacturing for low cost and rapid turnaround production; effects of source agnostic automation, where robots/tools from different manufacturers are combined, on overall manufacturing metrics; and difficulties associated with robot cooperative control with limited feedback in complex operations. Such knowledge, gained through hands-on learning, better prepares the future scientists and engineers to not only adapt in the highly demanding manufacturing environment of the future but also explore innovative solutions to complex technical problems. This project envisions to significantly surpass the learning experience offered by contemporary educational toys, including passive building sets, jigsaw puzzles, rule-based interactive toys and so on, by delivering a highly immersed, actively encouraging, and truly exploratory experience for the makers of tomorrow."
RAPID: Responsible, Ethical, and Effective Acceptable Use Policies for the Integration of Generative AI in US School Districts and Beyond;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The rapidly evolving space of artificial intelligence (AI) is requiring school and district leaders to make sense of how emerging technology applications, including those that use generative AI (GenAI), are being integrated in schools and districts across the United States. Much uncertainty exists about what GenAI is, how it works, and what the implications are for students, families, educators, and the broader school community. School and district leaders have shared challenges that they are facing regarding the use of AI for teaching and learning, including concerns around issues of privacy, data security, and bias. They are also concerned about existing inequities in accessing digital technologies and tools, and that this disparity could present further structural barriers for students and communities. To address the need for policies, guidelines, and guardrails, this project will recruit and convene a GenAI Working Group made up of school and district leaders that represent diverse identities and district demographics. The GenAI Working Group, in collaboration with a Digital Promise team and subject matter experts, will work to answer the following research questions: (1) What tensions do leaders experience when adapting acceptable use policies (AUPs) for emerging technologies such as GenAI? (2) What do acceptable use policies that are ethical, responsible, and effective look like? (3) How can districts develop policies that allow for learning to advance while protecting and centering human agency? This project will be both informative to the research field and have direct broad impacts via AUPs for districts and schools. The GenAI Working Group will: (1) write, adapt, and share a set of sample GenAI AUPs for a range of district contexts; (2) work with others at their districts to write and share their own district's AUPs for the responsible, ethical, and effective integration of GenAI; and (3) participate in a final public webinar where they will share what they learned about GenAI and their policies. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.

RAPID: DRL AI: Understanding Perceptions and Use of AI in K-12 Education Using a Nationally Representative Sample;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Schoolchildren are exposed to hundreds of digital tools each year, many of which are already driven by AI technologies. Parents and teachers must consider how to incorporate these learning tools into their daily lives at a rapid pace. Yet, very little is known about the current use and perceptions of AI among these key stakeholders. This time-sensitive RAPID project will identify the opportunities and challenges that arise for parents, teachers, and youth regarding the use of these AI-driven technologies in K-12 education. Specifically, it will identify risks of generative AI in educational settings and explore opportunities for supporting future design and engagement, including supports for teacher training and regulation in educational contexts. Findings will have theoretical and practical relevance for education, child development, technology design, and policy. Results will also support policymakers as they work to establish guidelines and regulations to protect youth???s privacy, safety, and well-being in the context of AI interactions. Ideally, this work will inform how AI might be used to close versus widen existing disparities and learning gaps in youth. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The study employs a large stratified random sample of parents, teachers, and youth across age, gender, socio-economic status, and geographical location. The probability-based nationally representative sample will be drawn from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel. The survey includes both open and close-ended questions that focus on use, perception, and trust in AI systems. Questions will probe how youth engage with generative AI as well as more traditional forms of AI in education, such as personalized and adaptive learning. An embedded experimental manipulation within the survey will test how participants evaluate AI-powered versus non-AI powered educational platforms with respect to usefulness, expertise, and trust. Qualitative interviews augment the survey findings, relying on remote participation to ensure broad geographic representation in a very short time window. Research materials will be made available as part of an online toolkit, enabling multiple investigators to use them across their studies and pool the data for future analyses through an open science approach. This large-scale mixed methods study will generate knowledge to directly inform policy guidelines regarding youth???s safety, privacy, and well-being in AI interactions. It is also positioned to help build design guidelines for AI product developers that prioritize child well-being, learning, and development.

Using applying facial emotion recognition to research emotional phases in an inquiry-based science activity;"Ezquerra, Angel; Agen, Federico; Toma, Radu Bogdan; Ezquerra-Romano, Ivan";2025;RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.1080/02635143.2023.2232995;;;;Yes;"BackgroundObservational and declarative approaches applied by human observers have dominated the study of emotions, engagement, and attention. However, these approaches are susceptible to biases such as social desirability. Additionally, declarative approach cannot measure these parameters in real-time.PurposeThis study aims to apply Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) technology in an inquiry-based activity to address the limitations of traditional observational and declarative approaches. We measured students' emotions, engagement, and attention through the parametric measurement of facial expressions frame by frame.Method and procedureWe recruited a convenience sample of 12 secondary education pre-service teachers. Students participated in a 20-minute inquiry-based activity where they were tasked with identifying the contents of a sealed black box. We recorded their facial expressions and actions with a video camera, and the collected data was subsequently analysed by both a FER automatic software and a human observer.ResultsDuring the activity, Attention had a mean presence of 81.24% & PLUSMN;5.93, Engagement had a presence of 31.86% & PLUSMN;9.10, Joy of 7.62% & PLUSMN;7.11, and Surprise of 6.57% & PLUSMN;4.61. The presence of the other discrete emotions was low. Our analysis further revealed an evolution of these parameters and students' actions, progressing through three distinct phases: accommodation to the problem (Phase 1), exploration of problem-solving strategies (Phase 2), and implementation of problem-solving strategies (Phase 3). Based on these observations, we grouped students into three patterns based on the phases they underwent throughout the activity.ConclusionThis study shows the application of FER technology for identifying and analysing the progression of students' emotions, engagement, and attention during an inquiry-based activity. FER technology allows real-time and systematic measurement of emotions, engagement, and attention. However, this technology has inherent limitations, and further research is needed to optimise its application in the educational setting."

Learning with Interactive Knowledge Representations;"Bredeweg, Bert; Kragten, Marco; Holt, Joanna; Kruit, Patricia; van Eijck, Tom; Pijls, Monique; Bouwer, Anders; Sprinkhuizen, Malou; Jaspar, Emile; de Boer, Muriel";2023;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app13095256;;;;Yes;Computers are promising tools for providing educational experiences that meet individual learning needs. However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning.
CAP: Support for Young Researchers to attend the International Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conference 2012;;2012;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) provides a forum for interchange of ideas around the applications of computer science to education and human learning. Presentations at the conference focus on developments and rigorous research around the design and use of interactive and adaptive learning technologies for learners of all ages, for subject matters that span the school curriculum, and for professional applications in industry, the military, and medicine. The conferences promotes cross-fertilization of information and ideas from several cyberlearning related fields: artificial intelligence, cognitive science, education, learning sciences, human-computer interaction, educational technology, psychology, and STEM disciplines. This project will support travel for advanced graduate students from US universities to attend the 11th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), to be held in Chania, Crete, in Greece, from June 15 to 18, 2012 (http://its2012.teicrete.gr). Those advanced graduate students will participate in the Young Research Track at the conference. That track is designed to provide young researchers with mentoring beyond what they get at their home institutions that will help them transition from graduate school to a fruitful research career. Young Researcher activities include structured poster sessions in which students present their work and one-on-one mentoring throughout the conference from a senior member of the ITS community who shares research interests with a young researcher and who comes from a different university and has a different approach than the young researcher experiences in his/her home institution. It is expected that conversations between peers and between mentors and mentees will continue throughout each young researcher's career. This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. This conference is unique in its synThesis and cross-fertilization across three STEM capacities: building cutting-edge learning technologies, investigating pedagogical methods that are theoretically grounded in the cognitive, social, and learning sciences, and rigorously testing the learning environments for their effectiveness at promoting learning (in STEM disciplines and other disciplines) among K-12, college, and workplace populations.

CAREER: Mechanisms enabling the flexible expression of visual concepts;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Technologies for expressing ideas in visual form have been critically important throughout human history. From ancient cave paintings to modern digital graphics, such technologies lie at the heart of some of our most significant inventions, including art, writing, and mathematics. Despite the importance of such technologies, little is known about how the human mind is capable of using them in such varied ways. Perhaps the most basic and versatile of these technologies is drawing, which can be used to convey information about the visual world at many levels of abstraction, ranging from realistic illustrations to simplified diagrams. This project will harness large datasets and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a rigorous understanding of the mental processes involved when people use drawings to communicate visual concepts in different ways. Results from this project will advance our understanding of why people prefer to use certain kinds of images in some contexts and not others, with implications for how to design effective visualizations for a variety of applications, including STEM education and research. This project???s focus on the problem of how abstract ideas can be communicated in clear and accessible ways extends to its education plan. This plan encompasses two initiatives to develop inclusive learning experiences that promote computational literacy among K-12 and undergraduate students that have historically faced systemic obstacles to this training. Aim 1 of this project seeks to resolve a classic debate concerning whether drawings derive their meaning by resembling objects in the world (i.e., are image-like) or by being composed of discrete symbolic expressions (i.e., are language-like). The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypoThesis that drawings are neither purely image-like nor purely language-like, but can vary strongly depending on what the illustrator can see, what they know, and what information they wish to communicate. To test this hypoThesis, the proposed analyses will employ crowdsourcing and computer-vision techniques to measure the degree to which different drawings preserve perceptual information and/or are organized into discrete symbolic units. For example, some drawings may contain rich visual details that resist summarization in words, while other drawings may be entirely composed of simpler marks that can be readily described using words. Aim 2 will investigate the process by which people come up with new ways to visually communicate with each other over time. The proposed experiments will evaluate the hypoThesis that drawings that initially resemble a concrete object tend to become increasingly abstract and symbol-like when people repeatedly communicate about it, reflecting shared goals and knowledge between communicators. The proposed analyses will measure consistency and variability in the resulting drawings, providing quantitative insight into the factors that affect the development of new symbolic systems for communication. Aim 3 seeks to better align the scientific training undergraduate psychology students receive to the reality of modern scientific practice in psychology. Specifically, it will integrate teaching of open-science best practices, exploratory data visualization, and model-based data analysis into the introductory statistics curriculum in Psychology at University of California San Diego, as well as collaborative final research projects to help students synthesize what they have learned and hone their communication skills. Aim 4 strives to broaden access to general education about artificial intelligence (AI) in historically underserved communities by partnering with local K-12 schools to develop learning experiences that illustrate the relevance of AI to students??? everyday lives, as well as how AI intersects with other disciplines, including the arts, psychology, medicine, and law. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CPS: TTP Option: Medium: Collaborative Research: Trusted CPS from Untrusted Components;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The nation's critical infrastructures are increasingly dependent on systems that use computers to control vital physical components, including water supplies, the electric grid, airline systems, and medical devices. These are all examples of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) that are vulnerable to attack through their computer systems, through their physical properties such as power flow, water flow, chemistry, etc., or through both. The potential consequences of such compromised systems include financial disaster, civil disorder, even the loss of life. The proposed work significantly advances the science of protecting CPS by ensuring that the systems do what they are supposed to do despite an attacker trying to make them fail or do harm. In this convergent approach, the key is to tell the CPS how it is supposed to behave and build in defenses that make sure each component behaves and works well with others. The proposed work has a clear transition to industrial practice. It will also enhance education and opportunity by opening up securing society as a fascinating discipline for K-12 students to follow. The objective of the proposed project is to produce, from untrusted components, a trusted Cyber-physical system (CPS) that is resilient to security attacks and failures. The approach will rely on information flows in both the cyber and physical subsystems, and will be validated experimentally on high fidelity water treatment and electric power CPS testbeds. The project brings together concepts from distributed computing, control theory, machine learning, and estimation theory to synthesize a complete mitigation of the security and operational threats to a CPS. The proposed method's key difference from current methods is that security holes will be identified and plugged automatically at system design time, then enforced during runtime without relying solely on secure boundaries or firewalls. The system will feature the ability to identify and isolate a malfunctioning device or cyber-physical intrusion in real-time by validating its operation against fundamental scientific/engineering principles and learned behavior. A combined mathematical/data science approach will be used to generate governing invariants that are enforced at system runtime. Invariants are a scientific approach grounded in the system's physics coupled with machine learning and real-time scheduling approaches embedded in the CPS. Robust state estimation will account for errors in measurement and automated security domain construction and optimization to reduce the cost of evaluation without sacrificing coverage. The successful outcome of this research will lead to improved national security across various CPS infrastructures which, in turn, will improve economic and population health and security. The work can be taken to industry for deployment in critical infrastructures. The project will stimulate interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) through the development of a water-themed tabletop exercise for K-12 and helping current college students develop an interest in outreach through the experiential learning aspects of developing the tabletop exercise. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

In this convergent approach, the key is to tell the CPS how it is supposed to behave and build in defenses that make sure each component behaves and works well with others. The proposed work has a clear transition to industrial practice. It will also enhance education and opportunity by opening up securing society as a fascinating discipline for K-12 students to follow. The objective of the proposed project is to produce, from untrusted components, a trusted Cyber-physical system (CPS) that is resilient to security attacks and failures. The approach will rely on information flows in both the cyber and physical subsystems, and will be validated experimentally on high fidelity water treatment and electric power CPS testbeds. The project brings together concepts from distributed computing, control theory, machine learning, and estimation theory to synthesize a complete mitigation of the security and operational threats to a CPS. The proposed method's key difference from current methods is that security holes will be identified and plugged automatically at system design time, then enforced during runtime without relying solely on secure boundaries or firewalls. The system will feature the ability to identify and isolate a malfunctioning device or cyber-physical intrusion in real-time by validating its operation against fundamental scientific/engineering principles and learned behavior. A combined mathematical/data science approach will be used to generate governing invariants that are enforced at system runtime. Invariants are a scientific approach grounded in the system's physics coupled with machine learning and real-time scheduling approaches embedded in the CPS. Robust state estimation will account for errors in measurement and automated security domain construction and optimization to reduce the cost of evaluation without sacrificing coverage. The successful outcome of this research will lead to improved national security across various CPS infrastructures which, in turn, will improve economic and population health and security. The work can be taken to industry for deployment in critical infrastructures. The project will stimulate interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) through the development of a water-themed tabletop exercise for K-12 and helping current college students develop an interest in outreach through the experiential learning aspects of developing the tabletop exercise. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Bio-Inspired Sensory Interfaces Incorporating Embedded Classification and Encryption;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Ubiquitous sensing and computing, leading to rapid growth of big data analysis, will potentially transform the world. That vision creates new challenges for pervasive sensory interfaces to enable the always-on feature, rapid analysis of information, and design for security to prevent cyberattacks. In the meantime, however, significant power will be consumed to run machine learning and complex cryptography algorithms. Critical challenges also exist in integrating classifiers and security measures into sensors to enable continuous monitoring. This project proposes an integrated program of research, education, and outreach to develop low-power sensory systems with theory, algorithms and architectures to enable in-sensor intelligence and security. The transformative aspects of this research project include fundamental understanding of bio-inspired computing, discovering useful intrinsic device characteristics, analysis of real-time data with adaptive machine learning, and exploring chaotic behaviors for efficient encryption. This research will have a significant impact on the needs of society for secure and continuous real-time monitoring to improve health, transportation, and environment through the developments of ubiquitous sensing and computing. This project also incorporates an integrated education plan to inspire and motivate younger generations with diverse backgrounds, in particular women and underrepresented minorities, to pursue education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. The plan will introduce the concepts of secure ubiquitous sensing and computing to undergraduate and graduate students, and create strong outreach activities to local K-12 students by illustrating easily-understood concepts of fundamental electronics and mathematics with compelling examples. The goal of this project is to develop ultra-low-power sensory interfaces that integrate autonomous sensing, classification, and secure measures into a single hardware platform. The bio-inspired classifiers incorporating combinatorial intrinsic characteristics emulate sophisticated biological systems where sensing, learning, and decision making are carried out through nonlinear and adaptive analog computing. The proposed architecture is driven by fast regeneration to extract relative timing information for hierarchical classification. Instead of using linear amplification and fine integration, inherent device mismatch and nonlinearity are exploited in time domain to achieve energy-efficient computation under low supply voltages. To process real-time data in sensors, Bernoulli variational distributions are employed for approximating the posterior to develop a computationally-efficient multi-layer neural network with Bayesian methods. The algorithm integrates medical knowledge and statistical analysis into the training process for adaptation to incoming signals. The proposed algorithm explores maximum sparsity in both sample and feature spaces, where regularizations of hardware constraints are included in the model to ensure robustness. Moreover, to perform encryption in sensors, the information will be randomized into deterministic noise for transmission. The pipeline chaotic system can be trained with time-varying maps to enhance the strength of the security without creating observable patterns to counter side-channel attacks. The transformation function is built with combinatorial intrinsic characteristics, which are physically unclonable to ensure complete security measures. This ensures data integrity and basic authentication for multi-layer security schemes from the edge sensors to the cloud while classification algorithms are performed locally in sensors to achieve rapid analysis and data reduction for wireless communications. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

CAREER: Irregular Modulation: Harnessing the Hidden Potential of PWM;;2024;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Modulation, since the birth of modern power electronics, bridges control algorithms with switch operations. Despite its significance, research related to modulation has seen relatively little progress in the past decade, generally due to the widespread use of sequential computing devices (e.g. digital signal processors). However, recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have propelled parallel computing devices into the forefront. To leverage the potential benefits of parallel computing devices and AI, this project proposes an irregular modulation theory, which can be easily applied to parallel computing devices and memristive devices. Additionally, this project will fully unlock the control capacity of modulation, enabling the control bandwidth to truly benefit from the high switching frequency brought in by Wide Bandgap (WBG) devices. This novel modulation approach will inevitably lead to the emergence of new topologies and control strategies, naturally giving rise to novel inverter modeling methodologies. Furthermore, the PI proposes a Mini-Task Inspired Learning Experience (M-TILE) approach to support students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in overcoming imposter syndrome. To extend the impact of M-TILE, this concept will be shared with local K-12 teachers through a one-day workshop. By deeply integrating irregular modulation and the M-TILE concept, education activities will offer world-class education, inspiring and training future leaders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The proposed irregular modulation theory will break free from the conventional idea of sawtooth and triangular carriers and lead to a new genre of converter modulation technologies. It will fundamentally change the operating principle of future power converters. Due to the fast response nature of modulation-control integration, it is possible to enable a new ultrafast control loop in addition to the classic double-loop control architecture. This new control loop will accommodate the recent advancement of AI technologies and lead to an entirely new genre of grid services. As a result of irregular modulation, a wide variety of new converter topologies, controls, and models will be revealed, holding the potential to eliminate vulnerable components and reduce voltage/current stress. Therefore, the irregular modulation theory proposed in this project will serve as the fundamental enabler of new topologies. This, in turn, will ultimately reduce device stress and component count, significantly lowering converter cost and enhancing reliability. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CRII: OAC: A Framework for Parallel Data-Intensive Computing on Emerging Architectures and Astroinformatics Applications;;2019;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The amount of data that needs to be analyzed by the scientific community is increasing due to growing volumes of data collected by current and future instruments and sensors. Consequently, scientific data analysis requires a significant amount of time. To decrease the amount of time needed to analyze data, methods need to utilize more computational resources, such as more processors in a computer. While the central processing unit (CPU) in a modern computer has traditionally been used to carry out data analysis, the past decade has seen an increase in using graphics processing units (GPUs) for data analysis. The modern graphics processing unit contains thousands of processors that can be used to execute a program faster than on the CPU. However, many algorithms for data analysis do not use the GPU to its full potential within the context of the broader computer system. This project advances a framework for understanding the performance of GPUs as applied to data analysis applications. The major goal of the project is to bridge the gap between algorithms that only use the GPU, and fully integrated algorithms that exploit the strengths of both the CPU and GPU. The ensemble of algorithms that are explored in the project support the needs of the astronomy community and researchers in other scientific areas that require efficient data analysis methods. The project aims to realize a new era in CPU/GPU computing that impacts both computer science and other scientific fields. An outcome of the project is the development of materials for educators teaching at the intersection of data analysis and parallel computing. This project includes mentoring K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Consequently, the project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science, and to advance the national health and prosperity. New cyberinfrastructure, such as data analysis algorithms for emerging heterogeneous architectures, are needed to address cutting-edge scientific problems. Data analysis building blocks and algorithms have many data-dependent performance bottlenecks. New architectures have the potential to alleviate some of these key bottlenecks. However, the majority of GPU research minimally involves the CPU/host, and performs most of the computation on the GPU. This is a missed opportunity to more closely integrate both data and task parallelism between the CPU and GPU to simultaneously exploit concurrency across both architectures. This project examines a selection of key algorithms in the database, machine learning, data mining, and parallel computing communities. Using these algorithms, this project explores the continuum between GPU-only and mixed hybrid parallelism (data and task parallelism between the CPU and GPU) to identify key bottlenecks that can be reduced by exploiting underutilized resources. The selected algorithms are fundamental to scientific data processing workflows, and can advance time-domain astronomy cyberinfrastructure. The project integrates data-intensive computing insights into courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and pedagogical modules are developed to be used by instructors for teaching concepts of mixed (data and task) parallelism across the CPU and GPU. This project includes mentoring students at the undergraduate, graduate, and K-12 levels, including outreach at science festivals to encourage participation and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
RAPID: DRL AI: The Development of a Digital Platform for Evaluating and Using AI-Generated Content for Academic Purposes;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Bard present new opportunities and challenges for learners in the elementary and middle grades. Despite their potential for facilitating and supporting scientific reading and writing, there are pressing concerns about how AI tools can produce harmful, biased, and false content, which then gets reproduced by users who lack sufficient critical evaluation skills or do not understand the importance of evaluating AI-generated content. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop instructional materials and strategies to support students??? development of these important critical thinking skills. The purpose of this time-sensitive project is to develop a web-based platform, called Compose With AI, aimed at guiding students to evaluate AI-generated content and use factual information to compose common types of science-focused writing (e.g., composing arguments, claims or solutions related to science topics). The Compose with AI platform will: 1) guide students to gather and critically evaluate content produced by AI, 2) guide students on beneficial and ethical uses of content produced by AI, and 3) scaffold students??? use of AI-generated content as a model and resource for composing science-focused texts. Project researchers will use gathered data to determine what critical evaluation approaches and strategies inhibit and enhance students??? abilities to use and critically evaluate content generated with AI, including when using the Compose With AI platform. The project team will follow a design-based implementation research approach to evaluate the usefulness and usability of the Compose With AI. Data to address the address the research questions will be collected as participants engage in a guided task where they use Compose With AI to evaluate AI-generated content and generate a response to a prompt. A verbal Reporting methodology will be used to understand students??? cognitive processes as they think aloud during the task (concurrently) and as they reflect on their work after the task (retrospectively). Verbal protocol analysis will focus on which approaches and strategies students selected from the list presented in the platform, how they used the strategies, which strategies were successful, and which uses of AI were most useful for integrating AI-generated content into their responses. Teacher participants will also provide feedback on the platform design and the student think-aloud tasks. All data will be combined and analyzed qualitatively to answer the research questions. Findings will be used to refine and publicly share the Compose With AI platform for classroom use. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Support for Doctoral Students from U.S. Universities to Attend the AIED 2013 and EDM 2013 Conferences;;2013;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Education (AIED 2013; http://aied2013.memphis.edu) and the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM 2013; http://edm2013.memphis.edu) provide professional opportunity for researchers from around the world to share results of cutting-edge research from the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), data mining, computer science, cognitive and learning sciences, psychology, and educational technology that focuses on the design and effective use of advanced learning technologies. AIED researchers aim to design new technologies and advance understanding of how to use those technologies and integrate them into learning environments so that their potential is fulfilled. EDM researchers focus on working towards better use of technology for collecting, analyzing, sharing, and managing data to shed light on learning, promoting learning, and designing learning environments. Researchers from both communities aspire to better understand how people learn with technology and how technology can be used productively to help people learn, through individual use and/or through collaborations mediated by technology. This project supports travel for advanced graduate students from US universities to attend these two conferences, held in Memphis, Tennessee, AIED 2013 from July 6 to 8, 2013, and EDM 2013 from July 10 to 12, 2013. Participating graduate students join the Doctoral Consortium (DC) tracks of the two conferences and are paired with a senior member of the AIED or EDM community for one-on-one mentoring throughout the conferences. The DC tracks of the conferences and mentor pairing are designed to provide young researchers with mentoring beyond what they get at their home institutions to help them transition from graduate school to a fruitful research career. DC track activities include structured poster sessions where students present their work, meetings with peers who have related interests, and interactions with senior members of the field. Each young researcher's one-on-one mentor will be senior members of the AIED/EDM community who shares research interests with the young researcher and who comes from a different university and has a different approach than the young researcher experiences in his/her home institution. It is expected that conversations between peers and between mentors and mentees will continue throughout each young researcher's career. This activity supports the mission of NSF to train more advanced professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Attending conferences is expensive for graduate students; funding their travel allows them to present their work to the larger community, speak individually with leaders in the field, and receive both support and advice from both senior researchers and peers. The AIED conference is special in its synThesis and cross-fertilization across three STEM capacities: building cutting-edge learning technologies, investigating pedagogical methods that are theoretically grounded in the cognitive, social, and learning sciences, and rigorously testing the learning environments for their effectiveness at promoting learning (in STEM and other disciplines) among K-12, college, and workplace populations. The EDM conference is special in its focus on learning how to use data collected as learners interact with learning technologies to assess learner understanding and capabilities so as to personalize feedback and advice."
MRI-R2: Development of Common Platform for Unifying Humanoids Research;;2010;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). Proposal #: 09-60061 PI(s): Kim, Youngmoo E., Gogotsi, Yury, Hong, Dennis H., Regli, William C., Schaal, Stefan Institution: Drexel University Title: Development of Common Platform for Unifying Humanoids Research Project Proposed: This project, developing and disseminating HUBO+, a new common humanoid research platform instrument, enables novel and previously infeasible capabilities for future research efforts while working with a common instrument. HUBO will be the first homogeneous, full-sized humanoid to be used as a common research and education platform. Eight universities (Drexel, CMU, MIT, Ohio State, Penn, Purdue, Southern California, and VaTech), representing a critical mass of humanoids research within US, participate in this development of the world's first homogeneous full-sized humanoid team. Building upon unique expertise, the work extends current capabilities, resulting in six identical units, facilitating the following potentially transformative advances in robotics: - A state-of-the-art, standardized humanoid platform instrument with embedded capabilities for sensing, manipulation, and rapid locomotion, ideal for a broad range of future humanoids research - The ability, for the first time, to directly compare and across validate algorithms and methodologies and consistently benchmark results across research teams - Novel energy storage technology for mobile robotics incorporating supercapacitors for operations requiring high power density, far exceeding the capabilities of traditional battery-only power sources - A widely distributed platform that motivates, recruits, and trains a broad range of students spanning multiple disciplines, including artificial intelligence, digital, signal processing, mechanics, and control Humanoids, robots engineered to mimic human form and motion, open broad avenues of cross disciplinary research spanning multiple fields, such as mechanical control, artificial intelligence, and power systems. Common humanoids are rarely autonomous and are not-ready for unconstrained interaction with humans. The most compelling demonstrations are meticulously pre-programmed and painstakingly choreographed. A few common platforms have already advanced some research. Hence, having a consistent platform should facilitate rapid progress in areas needed for autonomy and natural interaction, including mobility, manipulation, robot vision, speech communication, and cognition and learning. However, although currently Japan and Korea are considered world leaders in design and construction of humanoids, best practices have not been developed for constructing multiple, identical humanoids. These conditions call for the making of an urgently needed benchmark providing evaluations and cross-validation of results. With this development and the servicing of 6 humanoids, this project aims to create knowledge and best practices contributing to robotics research, possibly leading to the standardization needed for ubiquity. Broader Impacts: The instrument enables US researchers to develop expertise in the design and construction of humanoids, while the distribution of the work activities ensures the broad dissemination of the knowledge. Humanoids research, inherently interdisciplinary and integrative, inspires young students. The graduate and undergraduates students participating are likely to receive a world-class training in robotics. Outreach partners, including several high-profile museums will introduce people of all ages to the exciting technologies of robotics, particularly useful in recruiting K-12 students into science, engineering, mathematics, etc. A partnership with the Science Leadership Academy (SLA), a magnet school with more than 63% underrepresented students, assures their involvement. With SLA, the project initiates an annual program modeled on a NASA-style experiment design competition, in which students use simulation tools to propose humanoids projects and activities. Selected winner(s) will have their proposed projects implemented on HUBO.
Convergence HTF: A Workshop Shaping Research on Human-Technology Partnerships to Enhance STEM Workforce Engagement;;2017;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The landscape of jobs and work is changing rapidly, driven by the development of new technologies. Intelligent, automated machines and services are a growing part of jobs and the workplace. New technologies are enabling new forms of learning, skills assessments, and job training. The potential benefits of these technologies include increased productivity and satisfaction, and more job opportunities. The workshop supported by this award aims to harness these innovations to enhance the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) job opportunities and workforce engagement of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and related developmental disabilities. The workshop will promote the convergence of psychology, data science, computer science, engineering, learning science, special education, organizational behavior, and business to define key challenges and research imperatives at the nexus of humans, technology, and work.

These topics will integrate previously disparate disciplines and research approaches, with speakers encompassing a wide range of subject matter expertise; from engineers and technologists who are developing human-technology interfaces and devices, to psychologists who are harnessing human-technology partnerships to better understand unique human capabilities for STEM, to computer scientists who are studying and developing novel data-visualization approaches patterned on autistic visual thinking, to organizational scientists developing innovative employment models for the creation of STEM sector employment spaces and technologies that leverage and support autistic individuals in the workforce. The conclusions and recommendations from the workshop will be disseminated via a white paper, and will be used to design a research agenda to help leverage human-technology advances to maximize workforce opportunities and productivity."
Engaging Rural Students in Artificial Intelligence to Develop Pathways for Innovative Computing Careers;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamentally reshaping the workplace of the future and accelerating the demand for creating and sustaining an AI-literate workforce. This growing demand has highlighted the importance for all K-12 students to develop an understanding of AI to prepare them for future careers. Middle school years are crucial in shaping youth dispositions toward STEM. There is an urgent need nationally to develop a deep educational understanding of how to engage students during these years in learning AI and how to train and support teachers in AI education. The need to provide AI learning experiences is especially pronounced in rural areas, where students often lack access to advanced STEM educational opportunities. This project will introduce AI concepts to middle school students and teachers through summer camps, workshops, and school-based programs in rural communities of North Carolina. Over the course of the project, through co-design cycles with students and teachers, the project will iteratively develop an AI learning environment. With a focus on fostering students' creative expression, the learning environment will infuse AI learning into interactive digital game design activities that enable students to create personally meaningful and relevant game scenarios. In partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs in North Carolina, the project will offer summer camps for youth from underrepresented and underserved populations. The project will investigate which AI principles and concepts in the context of learning digital game development are most appropriate and engaging, and what are the support and scaffolding that teachers will require in integrating AI education into their instructional designs. The project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts, and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. The project will provide AI learning experiences to over 500 middle school students and AI-focused professional development to more than 20 teachers. Researchers will address three research questions: (1) How can we create engaging AI learning experiences for diverse rural populations of middle school students through game design activities? (2) How do we best support teachers in integrating AI learning experiences in their school-based programs? and (3) What is the impact of the learning program on diverse populations of rural middle grade students' knowledge of AI concepts, attitudes toward AI, and interest in AI careers? The project will leverage a design-based research approach to iteratively refine the program called AI Play, including the AI concepts to be addressed, the features to incorporate in the learning environment, and the scaffolding tools and pedagogical approaches to utilize. The research will use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods such as surveys, assessments, analysis of student artifacts, focus groups, and field observations to determine how the program impacts targeted outcomes for students and teachers. The deliverables of the project will include the AI Play program model and its associated curricular materials, the professional development model and its associated materials, the AI Play community website, and the research findings from the project. The aims of the project are to build knowledge on how to best help rural students develop foundational knowledge of AI concepts, how to promote meaningful explorations of AI for rural students, and design principles for creating engaging AI learning experiences that lead to increased student interest in AI-intensive fields. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

Fostering Computer Science and AI Learning through Youth-Led Conversational App Development Experiences;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Computing skills are essential for 21st-century workforce development, and artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly at the center of computationally rich careers. To remain at the forefront of global technology, the US needs a diverse workforce prepared with these skills. There is a tremendous pool of talented learners who are currently not given access to computer science and AI learning opportunities during the critical ages when they develop educational interests and career identities. Experiences during K-12 have a significant impact on those identities and resulting career path choices. This project will engage historically marginalized middle school students in Alachua County, Florida in a summer program that teaches them computer science and AI concepts. Through an authentic inquiry process centered on developing conversational AI, spoken technologies that engage users in conversation, students will investigate and create innovative computational applications. Young learners will have the opportunity to develop skills in the design and implementation of a variety of personally relevant projects including speech assistants, question-answering systems, and games. These projects can offer meaningful engagement that has the potential to transform the way middle school students view computing and AI careers. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. In this project, 210 students from diverse, underserved schools with limited access to AI and computer science will engage in two-week summer experiences to learn computer science and conversational AI development. The curriculum design is guided by the theoretical framework of a four-phase process model of interest development from initial situational interest to the eventual well-developed individual interest. Researchers in computer science and educational technology from the University of Florida will investigate the following overarching research question: In what ways can a summer development experience around spoken conversational apps foster middle school students' cognitive outcomes around computing and social-emotional outcomes of interest and identity formation related to STEM careers? The project will use a mixed-method research design to test the hypoThesis that students will achieve significant knowledge gain as measured on a pre/post-test for computer science concepts, and that students will show a progression in the use of user-centered design practices as evidenced by source code analysis and mapping both the prototyping and user testing processes they undertake. The project will also test the hypoThesis that students will display a significantly increased sense of identity and interest formation toward STEM careers. The research team will analyze patterns of collaboration and participation to explain why the learning experience supports these outcomes. The project will answer important research questions on how to engage middle school students in learning AI and what type of learning outcomes are achievable. This research has the potential to shed light on the emerging field of AI education within the context of computer science and conversational applications for the K-12 population. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
SynThesis and design workshop: Research Priorities in Learning Analytics;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This workshop is funded through the Dear Colleague Letter: Principles for the Design of Digital Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Learning Environments (NSF 18-017). Post-secondary educational institutions are being buffeted by three major transitions: changes in the nature of the competencies students need and want, changes in the demographic mix of people that they serve, and changes in the technologies and strategies available to build, measure, and communicate competence and expertise. Powerful new information technologies, unprecedented opportunities to gather and analyze large volumes of data, and new insights into how people learn, make it possible to imagine designing learning environments that make learning more productive, more affordable, and more gracefully adaptable to individuals throughout their lifetimes. The new field of learning analytics has made major advances in understanding how educational Big Data can produce insights to improve classroom practices. Yet, a number of critical questions remain unanswered in important areas to ensure all Americans receive the education they need to prosper in a modern economy. The aim of this workshop is to investigate the role of learning analytics in contributing to advances in technological learning environments. The workshop will bring together interdisciplinary experts to articulate the state-of-the-art and propose research priorities for learning analytics in the coming decade. A central theme will be to explore new ways to use powerful tools in data science (machine learning, social network analysis, analytics and visualization of complex data, temporal, multi-scale and statistical models, integration of heterogeneous data, data scrubbing, wrangling and provenance tracking, data privacy and cybersecurity) to define competence, measure it, and build it using a rich array of new approaches to study learning. The workshop will also explore how the full power of these tools can be applied to the most critical challenges faced in learning analytics. The outcome of the workshop will be a clear definition of the highest priority research needs in learning analytics and a practical roadmap to guide public and private research support in these areas. The resulting white paper will provide insights to improve a wide range of learning environment contexts in in post-secondary education. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Category II: ACES - Accelerating Computing for Emerging Sciences;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The ever-growing complexity of Science and Engineering (S&E) workflows and expectations of Open Science have encouraged researchers to adopt new technologies, such as containerization, virtualization and composability, that enable them to respond to an increasingly complex cyberinfrastructure (CI) landscape while producing shareable, and reproducible results. ACES (Accelerating Computing for Emerging Sciences), an innovative advanced computational prototype to be developed by Texas A&M University, tries to answer a fundamental question: how does one effectively offer a holistic computing platform that can simultaneously meet the needs of a continuum of users in diverse research communities with varying levels of computing adoption? The project will allow researchers to creatively develop new programming models and workflows that utilize these architectures while simultaneously advancing HPC (High Performance Computing) and data science projects. The ACES platform removes significant bottlenecks in advanced computing by introducing the flexibility to aggregate various components (i.e., processors, accelerators and memory) on an as-needed basis to solve problems that were previously not addressable. By letting researchers switch and run on accelerators best suited for their workflows, ACES will benefit many research and development projects in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), cybersecurity, health population informatics, genomics and bioinformatics, human and agricultural life sciences, oil & gas simulations, de novo materials design, climate modeling, molecular dynamics, quantum computing architectures, imaging, smart and connected societies, geosciences, and quantum chemistry. Toward facilitating researcher use, ACES will offer avenues for interactive computing, portals, and cloud connectivity. ACES will support the national research community through coordination systems supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Finally, ACES will also leverage existing efforts that promote science and broaden participation in computing at the K-12, collegiate, and professional levels to have a transformative impact nationally by focusing on training, education and outreach. ACES activities are designed to expand the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in computing and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), particularly at minority-serving institutions. ACES will offer fellowships to students, continue efforts to support teacher programs, and offer a number of formal and informal courses, whose materials will be offered to the national community for use free-of-charge. This project funds the development of a dynamically composable high-performance data analysis and computing platform, named ACES. AI and ML are integrated with traditional simulation and modeling approaches in the pursuit of innovation. Edge-computing and instrumental probes have pushed the need to verify, process, store, analyze, and query vast amounts of unstructured data in real time. The coupling of analytics with closely-situated data on highly-usable web-based technologies connected to a compute backend have led to a paradigm shift in expectations from research computing environments. The ACES innovative composable hardware platform helps accelerate transformative changes in research areas that can leverage novel High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) processors and accelerators for analytics and computing. ACES leverages Liqid???s composable framework via PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect express) Gen5 on Intel???s HBM Sapphire Rapid processors to offer a rich accelerator testbed consisting of Intel Ponte Vecchio GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), Intel FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), NEC Vector Engines, NextSilicon co-processors, Graphcore IPUs (Intelligence Processing Units). The accelerators are coupled with Intel Optane memory and DDN Lustre storage interconnected with Mellanox NDR 400Gbps (gigabit-per-second) InfiniBand to support workflows that benefit from optimized devices. ACES will enable applications and workflows to dynamically integrate the different accelerators, memory, and in-network computing protocols to glean new insights by rapidly processing large volumes of data, and provide researchers with a unique platform to produce complex hybrid programming models that effectively supports calculations that were not feasible before. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Orchestrating Edge Infrastructures and Mobile Devices under Uncertainty to Provision Edge AI as a Service;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often trained by data first, and then used to perform inference upon data which may have never been seen. Today's AI services are mostly trained in remote data centers and accessed via the Internet. However, increasingly, as large volumes of training data are generated by end users and inference tasks are also performed on premises, AI needs to be moved to the network edge in closer proximity to users. The objective of this project is to address this emerging paradigm shift by orchestrating the distributed computing and networking infrastructures and provisioning AI as a service from the network edge to serve large numbers of users at different locations. This project will define the optimization problems, design the control algorithms, and develop the deployable implementations for operating AI as a service across cloud-edge networks and mobile devices. Centered on system dynamics and uncertainty, the project consists of multiple research thrusts. First, the project will optimize the training and the inference of AI through making smart decisions on participant selection, model placement, aggregation control, and request dispatching, and will produce time-based algorithms running in an online manner with provable performance guarantees. Second, the project will investigate the interactions among different parties in the AI service ecosystem from an economics perspective, and will devise incentive mechanisms towards superior resource utilization and optimal social welfare with desired economic properties. Third, the project will conduct a combination of simulations, measurements, and implementations with real-world data traces and realistic experimental settings to comprehensively evaluate and validate the models, algorithms, and systems. This project will impact the industry by providing telecom carriers, network operators, and service providers with a critical set of techniques to enable them to provision and operate dedicated or value-added edge-AI services upon distributed infrastructures. Further, the project will devise novel theories and algorithms based on the mathematics of optimization, control, learning, and mechanism design, and could be of independent interest and have extended applications to problems in other related fields that also face dynamic and uncertain inputs. Finally, besides contributing to undergraduate and graduate course materials, the project will execute the education plan that focuses on facilitating K-12 education via training teachers and also equipping students with AI knowledge and experiences in an ethical manner. The deliverables of this project, which include but are not limited to papers, data, and codes, will be made publicly available at the following website: https://github.com/ai-at-edge. This website will be updated in time for the duration of this project and maintained online thereafter.

EAGER: Developing AI Literacy Interventions to Teach Fundamental Concepts in AI;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a foundational technology that impacts on every sector of the economy and every corner of society. AI???s rapid expansion across fields and industries and its dramatic impact on the economy and national security necessitate developing a workforce knowledgeable and capable of working with AI. There is an urgent need to research K-12 students??? capacity to learn AI concepts and processes and how best to support their development of AI skills and career interests. Meanwhile, broadening participation in AI is an important need in AI workforce development. Engaging students from underrepresented groups in AI education can help ensure that the design, development, and utilization of AI technologies are inclusive and equitable. The objective of this project is to build field-advancing knowledge about 1) appropriate measurements and instruments to assess middle school students??? concept knowledge, awareness of AI and perceptions about AI, and career orientation; and 2) whether and how students are able to learn key AI concepts and become more interested in AI and related careers. This knowledge will be generated through investigating the learning outcomes and efficacy of an AI curriculum in informal learning contexts with students from diverse backgrounds, including Hispanic/Latinx and African American learners. The project specifically addresses middle school students (ages 11-13) because the middle school years are a critical time for students to begin exploring careers related to their interests. In order to develop a diverse AI workforce, it is important to expose students to the wide range of applicability of AI and the career options it confers. Many of the AI learning activities produced through the project are not dependent on the availability of computers, contributing to multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in AI learning experiences for underserved students who do not have consistent access to Internet services . This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Researchers will focus on four research questions: 1) What are students??? perceptions and attitudes towards AI and how do they change, if at all, as a result of the interventions? 2) What knowledge and skills do students develop through the interventions? 3) What kinds of interactions between youth and curriculum materials, tools, and peers facilitate students??? conceptual development? and 4) What connections do students make, if any, between the skills they learn and application of those skills in various STEM and computer science careers and fields? The project team will use a design based research approach in conducting expert reviews, focus groups, and a pilot test to iteratively test and refine the curriculum, measures, and assessments. The team will then conduct an efficacy study to collect and analyze data to generate estimates of the impact of the intervention on youths??? perceptions of and attitudes toward AI, learning of concepts in AI, and career adaptability. Additionally, video and interaction analyses, cognitive interviews, and case studies with thematic analyses will be used to gain an understanding of student engagement with the AI activities; student interactions that facilitated learning such as interactions between students and curriculum materials, students and tools, and students and their peers; and the best strategies to support them to pursue AI related careers. The project???s deliverables include: the Developing AI LIteracy (DAILy) curriculum; the Attitudes Toward AI, AI Concept Inventory and AI Career Futures surveys; and the research findings. The project???s outcomes will build the knowledge base on appropriate measurements and instruments, students??? learning processes, how and to what extent students can learn AI concepts in middle school, and the efficacy of the intervention with an audience of underrepresented youth. The research has potential to advance the field of AI education by contributing to the definition of AI literacy, forming the basis for subsequent research on learning trajectories in K-12 AI education, and generating understandings that are foundational to developing education programs that will prepare a workforce knowledgeable and capable of working with AI.

This project provides undergraduate and graduate students in the Northern Plains region with access and opportunity to learn using state-of-the-art smart grid cyberinfrastructure. The Northern Plains region sees increasing use and potential in renewable energy, in addition to energy exports to other areas, solidifying the importance of advanced training in power engineering. The project thus serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science and to secure the national defense. The resulting curriculum and instructional materials integrate advanced skills from multiple areas into power engineering infrastructure education. Students practice the multi-disciplinary skillsets needed for the power industry using a unique, remotely connected smart grid cyberinfrastructure. They extend their academic and research portfolios and strengthen their career competitiveness as smart grid cyberinfrastructure professionals and cyberinfrastructure users for regional and national levels. The cyber training model leverages resources for underrepresented minority schools and schools with limited research cyberinfrastructure to participate, either remotely or on-site. The mobile microgrid laboratory demonstrations introduce K-12 teachers and students to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics majors. This project establishes a new, remotely-connected smart grid cyberinfrastructure platform between the collaborative institutes using a real-time digital simulator, and sharing software licenses and hardware resources. This project promotes the application of advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques in power system monitoring, planning, operation and control, and prepares the next-generation power engineers to face challenges in modern power systems. This remotely connected power cyberinfrastructure provides an ideal platform for interdisciplinary research and education of computational intelligence, machine learning, control, communications, and data analytics in the smart grid area. The project team collects heterogeneous smart grid measurement data from this new cyberinfrastructure to conduct real-time learning, event-detection and data integrity, online optimization and multi-level decision-making process of intelligent systems. The project team integrates results into existing undergraduate courses and expand graduate courses from a frontier interdisciplinary viewpoint. The project team also creates replicable project templates/demos with designated benchmark data so other schools can easily adopt this new educational model with or without specific resources. Feedback from an independent evaluator, institutional stakeholders, national laboratory scientists and local industry partners supports periodic improvement of the educational model and materials. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Sparse Graph-Based Codes for Network Data Compression;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Driven by emerging systems, such as the Internet-of-things (smart homes, wearables, connected cars, and so on), society is generating and using massive amounts of data at an ever increasing rate. For example, the amount of data created over the next three years is predicted to be more than that created over the past 30 years. Without significant technological advances, existing communications infrastructure will not be able to cope with this exponential increase. This project addresses this challenge by exploring how such data can be compressed over networks to significantly reduce the traffic that needs to be transmitted. The main idea is to explore new data-compression schemes that leverage untapped gains by exploiting similarities and structure in the data as well as how the devices are connected in the network. Examples include transmitting many related measurements in different locations of the power grid to a single destination, or transmitting a video replay to the individual devices of a large crowd in a sports stadium. As such, the proposed research promises to provide a significant transformative impact on many critical applications employing reliable networked data compression, for example in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and finance. The project also includes an integrated education plan to increase participation in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), particularly among minority groups. This objective is supported by several complementary initiatives, including targeted K-12 activities as well as related teacher training and mentoring. The proposed research significantly advances the state of the art in network data compression by employing ideas from network coding, graph theory, iterative information processing, machine learning, and circuit design. The project involves several fundamental themes related to network-aware, low-complexity, and throughput-efficient data compression schemes which are not present in previous studies: a theoretical analysis and design of general schemes for lossy source coding, involving a characterization of finite-length scaling properties under message passing encoding and analysis of harmful graphical substructures; an investigation of the fundamental rate-distortion performance of nested graph-based codes in canonical network structures, exploring the achievable network gains in compression for practical spatially coupled constructions; and algorithmic advances and novel high-speed field programmable gate array hardware architectures. The theoretical results of this project have the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of coding strategies to achieve network gains in source compression, opening new opportunities and challenges. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
RAPID DRL AI: Empowering Teachers to Collaborate with Generative AI for Developing High-Quality STEM Learning Resources;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;The rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have presented tremendous opportunities to create interactive, personalized learning resources on a large scale. To fully harness the educational potential of these technologies, it is crucial that teachers - who are at the forefront of daily student interaction and possess indispensable knowledge and expertise - serve as key contributors in the process. This time-sensitive project addresses the urgent need for viable mechanisms to empower teachers to harness the capabilities of LLMs through a teacher-AI collaboration paradigm in the context of learning through video. The research team will partner with WGBH Educational Foundation (GBH), Boston???s PBS station, to support teachers in creating and customizing an intelligent tutor that accompanies the STEM learning resources available on PBS LearningMedia, a platform already popular among teachers nationwide, with a comprehensive library of over 5,000 high quality STEM-focused videos and millions of users. This proposal was received in response to the Dear Colleague Letter (DCL): Rapidly Accelerating Research on Artificial Intelligence in K-12 Education in Formal and Informal Settings (NSF 23-097) and funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. Intelligent tutors will be incorporated into videos and pose comprehension questions to students and provide personalized feedback during video viewing. The team will iteratively design and develop a teacher-AI collaborative platform that allows teachers to oversee the intelligent tutors??? generation of question sequences and feedback. The platform will provide LLM building blocks for teachers to steer LLMs to generate desirable outputs. Thus, teachers maintain control over the tutors' instructional dialogue with students, ensuring such dialogue aligns with teachers??? instructional objectives and the unique needs of their students. The team will then generate evidence demonstrating the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and specific design strategies that enable non-technical domain experts to have significant involvement in the development of AI-based educational resources. This project has the potential for a substantial broader impact, as it builds upon the existing PBS LearningMedia platform. This ensures the sustainability of the proposed platform and reach a large number of educators. By making the platform publicly available, this research will enable educators to continue generating interactive videos that cater to their specific educational needs. This work holds the promise of democratizing access to AI for teachers and promoting their active involvement in the production of AI-based learning resources.

CAREER: Nonlinear Factor Analysis for Sensing and Learning;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;Factor analysis (FA) tools, e.g., nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and independent component analysis (ICA), are the cornerstones of many sensing and learning applications, e.g., document analytics, hyperspectral imaging, brain signal processing, and representation learning. FA tools are designed to discover meaningful latent information from data (e.g., prominent topics in a collection of documents) in an unsupervised manner. However, classic FA models do not consider unknown nonlinear distortions that often happen in data acquisition/generation, and thus frequently fail to produce sensible results in critical scenarios. This project will develop a suite of nonlinear factor analysis (NFA) tools that will transform existing FA paradigms by effectively and provably handling unknown nonlinearities. Results from this project will significantly advance the understanding of fundamental properties and computational aspects of various NFA models, including model identifiability, sample complexity, noise robustness and algorithm convergence---which are largely uncharted research territories. The products will boost the performance of a broad spectrum of sensing and learning tasks in science and engineering where unknown nonlinear distortions often arise, e.g., remote sensing, brain-computer interface, vision/image/text data analytics, bioinformatics, geoscience, biology, and ecology. The integrated education plan of developing visually appealing FA and NFA-based course modules and software will alleviate ???math anxiety??? in K-12 and college. The precollege outreach programs and undergraduate research plans will effectively foster early interest in mathematics and enhance underrepresented students??? participation in STEM disciplines. These education activities will lead to a diversified and mathematically competitive future workforce for signal and machine intelligence. This project will develop a unified analytical and computational framework for learning various challenging and realistic NFA models. Specifically, Thrust I will develop a unified functional equation-based framework for provable unsupervised nonlinear model identification under various NFA settings. Thrust II will make important advances towards understanding NFA under realistic conditions (e.g., finite sample and noisy cases), and will offer effective NFA optimization algorithms with performance guarantees. Thrust III will carefully evaluate the proposed approaches over timely and important sensing and learning tasks including hyperspectral imaging, biosensor signal processing, and unsupervised machine learning. These thrusts will produce fundamental results in both theory and algorithms addressing critical challenges in NFA. The new functional equation-based analytical framework offers a theoretical underpinning for various NFA model identification problems that are beyond the reach of existing tools. The new NFA performance characterization tools under realistic settings (e.g., finite data) will be a substantial leap forward from existing works that all use overly ideal assumptions (e.g., unlimited data). The computational framework through an integration of statistical analysis, neural network learning, and nonlinear programming will offer provable and flexible algorithms for NFA problems, which all currently lack guaranteed solutions. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

This project promotes the application of advanced cyberinfrastructure techniques in power system monitoring, planning, operation and control, and prepares the next-generation power engineers to face challenges in modern power systems. This remotely connected power cyberinfrastructure provides an ideal platform for interdisciplinary research and education of computational intelligence, machine learning, control, communications, and data analytics in the smart grid area. The project team collects heterogeneous smart grid measurement data from this new cyberinfrastructure to conduct real-time learning, event-detection and data integrity, online optimization and multi-level decision-making process of intelligent systems. The project team integrates results into existing undergraduate courses and expand graduate courses from a frontier interdisciplinary viewpoint. The project team also creates replicable project templates/demos with designated benchmark data so other schools can easily adopt this new educational model with or without specific resources. Feedback from an independent evaluator, institutional stakeholders, national laboratory scientists and local industry partners supports periodic improvement of the educational model and materials. This project is funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate for Engineering. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
CAREER: Mining Genome-wide Chemical-Structure Activity Relationships in Emergent Chemical Genomics Databases;;2009;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). The objective of this proposal is to develop an integrated research and education program for advancing the underlying theoretical and computational principles of data mining in the emergent chemical genomics databases. The core technical innovations that this research aims to advance are: (i) developing effective kernel-based representations and structure pattern extraction and selection methods to capture the intrinsic characteristics of irregular and discrete spaces such as the chemical space, (ii) designing methods for adaptive and scalable similarity search in large databases of complex data and methods for accurate classification models, and (iii) deriving application oriented validation. A key strength of this work is the application of the theoretic and computational advancements to real-world problems, namely, chemical toxicity prediction based on microarray gene expression profiles and high-throughput chemical screening. Collaborators in academia, industry, and government agencies will evaluate the new algorithms. The data mining knowledge gained will be applicable beyond the chemical domain; examples of such applications include social network analysis and sensor network analysis. The PI will work closely with the Center of Excellence in Chemical Methodologies and Library Development at the University of Kansas (KU CMLD) to evaluate research prototypes. Intellectual Merit This research addresses the fundamental problem of learning functional dependencies between arbitrary input and output domains. In particular, this research: 1) focuses on complex input domain, the space of all chemicals, 2)aims to derive a uniform representation of the domain by working on innovative tools for graphs and geometric structures that are associated with the domain, 3) will provide practical tools to search through the domain, and will design new algorithms that uncover real connections between the input domain to an equally complex output domain (a space of biological entities). The data mining knowledge gained from this project will provide the research community with much better techniques for searching, mining, and analyzing domains of complex data and for uncovering the real connections between domains of complex data. The proposed research is a timely effort to integrate and advance knowledge in three communities: cheminformatics, data mining, and machine learning. Broader Impact Accurate data mining tools for chemical structure-activity relationship discovery will simplify and accelerate drug discovery and hence improve human health. Better prediction tools for chemical activity including toxicity will lead to better strategies for environmental monitoring and preservation. Deep understanding of chemical structure-activity relationships should enable rational material design in the research for renewable and clean energy. The research program is strongly linked to the educational goals of this proposal, which are, among others, (i) to enrich curriculum for the undergraduate and graduate education in new interdisciplinary training programs and (2) to encourage K-12 and undergraduate students to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)."
Collaborative Research: EnCORE: Institute for Emerging CORE Methods in Data Science;;2022;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The proliferation of data-driven decision making, and its increased popularity, has fueled rapid emergence of data science as a new scientific discipline. Data science is seen as a key enabler of future businesses, technologies, and healthcare that can transform all aspects of socioeconomic lives. Its fast adoption, however, often comes with ad hoc implementation of techniques with suboptimal, and sometimes unfair and potentially harmful, results. The time is ripe to develop principled approaches to lay solid foundations of data science. This is particularly challenging as real-world data is highly complex with intricate structures, unprecedented scale, rapidly evolving characteristics, noise, and implicit biases. Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort across multiple scientific disciplines such as statistics for robust decision making under uncertainty; mathematics and electrical engineering for enabling data-driven optimization beyond worst case; theoretical computer science and machine learning for new algorithmic paradigms to deal with dynamic and sensitive data in an ethical way; and basic sciences to bring the technical developments to the forefront of health sciences and society. The proposed institute for emerging CORE methods in data science (EnCORE) brings together a diverse team of researchers spanning the afore-mentioned disciplines from the University of California San Diego, University of Texas Austin, University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California Los Angeles. It presents an ambitious vision to transform the landscape of the four CORE pillars of data science: C for complexities of data, O for optimization, R for responsible learning, and E for education and engagement. Along with its transformative research vision, the institute fosters a bold plan for outreach and broadening participation by engaging students of diverse backgrounds at all levels from K-12 to postdocs and junior faculty. The project aims to impact a wide demography of students by offering collaborative courses across its partner universities and a flexible co-mentorship plan for truly multidisciplinary research. With regular organization of workshops, summer schools, and seminars, the project aims to engage the entire scientific community to become the new nexus of research and education on foundations of data science. To bring the fruit of theoretical development to practice, EnCORE will continuously work with industry partners, domain scientists, and will forge strong connections with other National Science Foundation Harnessing Data Revolution institutes across the nation. EnCORE as an institute embodies intellectual merit that has the potential to lead ground-breaking research to shape the foundations of data science in the United States. Its research mission is organized around three themes. The first theme on data complexity addresses the complex characteristics of data such as massive size, huge feature space, rapid changes, variety of sources, implicit dependence structures, arbitrary outliers, and noise. A major overhaul of the core concepts of algorithm design is needed with a holistic view of different computational complexity measures. Faced with noise and outliers, uncertainty estimation is both necessary, and at the same time difficult, due to dynamic and changing data. Data heterogeneity poses major challenges even in basic classification tasks. The structural relationships hidden inside such data are crucial in the understanding and processing, and for downstream data analysis tasks such as in visualization and neuroscience. The second theme of EnCORE aims to transform the classical area of optimization where adaptive methods and human intervention can lead to major advances. It plans to revisit the foundations of distributed optimization to include heterogeneity, robustness, safety, and communication; and address statistical uncertainty due to distributional shift in dynamic data in control and reinforcement learning. The third and final theme of EnCORE proposes to build the foundations of responsible learning. Applications of machine learning in human-facing systems are severely hampered when the learned models are hard for users to understand and reproduce, may give biased outcomes, are easily changeable by an adversary, and reveal sensitive information. Thus, interpretability, reproducibility, fairness, privacy, and robustness must be incorporated in any data-driven decision making. The experience and dedication to mentoring and outreach, collaborative curriculum design, socially aware responsible research program, extensive institute activities, and industrial partnerships would pave the way for a substantial broader impact for EnCORE. Summer schools with year-long mentoring will take place in three states involving a large demography. Joint courses with hybrid, and fully online offerings will be developed. Utilizing prior experience of running Thinkabit lab that has impacted over 74,000 K-12 students so far, EnCORE will embark on an ambitious and thoughtful outreach program to improve the representation of under-represented groups and help create a future generation of workforce that is diverse, responsible, and has solid foundations in data science.

Human/AI Co-Orchestration of Dynamically-Differentiated Collaborative Classrooms;;2018;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"This project will create and demonstrate new technology that supports dynamically-differentiated instruction for the classroom of the future. This new vision centers on carefully-designed partnerships between teachers, students, and artificial intelligence (AI). AI-powered learning software will support students during problem-solving practice, providing either individual guidance (using standard intelligent tutoring technology) or guidance so students can effectively collaborate and tutor each other. These learning activities are constantly adjusted to fit each student's needs, including switching between individual or collaborative learning. The teacher orchestrates (instigates, oversees, and regulates) this dynamic process. New tools will enhance the teacher's awareness of students' classroom progress. The goal is to have highly effective and efficient learning processes for all students, and effective orchestration support for teachers. We will implement and test this vision in the context of AI-enhanced mathematics learning in middle school. The proposed work will greatly enhance current understanding of how to design effective AI-based co-orchestration tools that draw on complementary strengths of teachers, students/peers, and AI agents to make the vision of the dynamically-differentiated classroom feasible. It will provide insight into the new classroom dynamics that arise. The work may ultimately contribute to more individualized K-12 education. The work will create a testbed that could be used to explore and rigorously test a wide range of interesting hypotheses regarding co-orchestration and dynamic differentiation of individual and collaborative learning. Effective orchestration of dynamically-differentiated instruction poses significant challenges in terms of design and technical implementation. Although existing AI-based learning technologies support forms of dynamic differentiation of instruction, they tend not to support dynamic combinations of individual and collaborative learning; in fact, most only support one of these two learning modes. In addition, existing teacher support tools tend to focus only on enhancing teacher awareness, not on supporting teachers' in-the-moment decision-making and action, and not on supporting dynamic interleaving of individual and collaborative learning. In the proposed work, we tackle this challenge by integrating and extending four strands of work: intelligent tutoring systems technology; a learning environment to support combinations of individual and collaborative learning; adaptive technology support for mutual peer tutoring; and a mixed reality tool (smart glasses) to support teacher/AI co-orchestration. Building on this foundation, we create and demonstrate technology support for dynamically-differentiated instruction by three strands of work. First, we create AI-based tutoring software capable of supporting both individual learners and students doing mutual peer tutoring. Second, we develop a tool to support the intelligent, real-time co-orchestration, between students, teachers, and AI agents, of dynamically differentiated combinations of collaborative learning and individual learning. We do so through design-based research, prototyping, and classroom piloting. Third, we evaluate the newly-created technology for dynamically-differentiated collaborative classroom in schools, to gain an initial understanding of its benefits and challenges, and the changes in classroom practices and learning outcomes that it brings about. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scholarships to Accelerate Engineering Leadership and Identity in Graduate Students;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;This project will contribute to the national need for well-educated scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, a nationally ranked research university that facilitates academic success and upward mobility of low-income, academically talented students. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 90 unique full-time students who are pursuing accelerated graduate B.S./M.S. degrees in engineering. Students will receive one-year scholarships in the master???s year of study. The program leverages established accelerated B.S/M.S. programs and research efforts in the college of engineering that support the maritime economy. It is designed to provide a coordinated program for high-achieving, low-income undergraduate student recruitment, and workforce development strategies to prepare and graduate M.S.-level students to address challenges in marine biotechnology, marine renewable energy, marine artificial intelligence and robotics, marine restoration, and water resources and protection. The project will provide scholarships to students to allow them to participate in activities that are intended to foster improved self-efficacy and engineering identity development. The intellectual merit of the project will be knowledge generation on the role of self-efficacy and engineering identity among undergraduate students who continue to pursue engineering through graduate degree attainment. The broader impact will be the implementation and sustainability of effective evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities, including professional development practices, for high-achieving, low-income students pursuing master???s degrees so they are prepared for entry into the workforce or graduate Ph.D. programs in engineering. The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving graduate students with demonstrated financial need. The program addresses the following three critical needs: (1) promotion of graduate degree attainment by high-achieving, low-income students to address demands for a workforce with master???s-level preparation in engineering, (2) implementation of evidence-based academic and student support activities that foster non-cognitive factors such as improved self-efficacy and engineering identity development and help undergraduate students make the transition to graduate degree programs, and (3) graduation of leaders skilled in technology, entrepreneurship and innovation to build and support the economy of the South Coast of New England, a diverse, post-industrial region characterized by high poverty. The specific aims for the program are to (1) double the application and recruitment of students with demonstrated financial need to accelerated B.S./M.S. programs in engineering, (2) double the participation, student success, and graduation of engineering M.S. students, (3) advance the research, leadership and entrepreneurship skills of engineering graduate students, and (4) generate and disseminate knowledge on engineering identity and self-efficacy, and evidence-based curricular and co-curricular activities that affect student recruitment, persistence, and M.S. degree attainment. Research has shown that students who persist in engineering tend to exhibit high levels of self-efficacy and identify themselves as belonging to an engineering community. While there have been studies on the role of engineering identity on the transition from K-12 to post-secondary education, few studies on either engineering identity or challenges related to self-efficacy have investigated the transition from undergraduate to graduate-level programs. Furthermore, there have been few studies of the impact of institutional support during these transitional years on recruitment and persistence of engineering graduate students, and the role of engineering identity and self-efficacy development in this process. Research questions will include: (1) To what extent do the project???s curricular and co-curricular activities increase the number of low-income, academically talented students entering graduate programs in engineering? (2) What cognitive and non-cognitive aspects of students??? experiences with curricular and co-curricular activities support engineering identity and self-efficacy among LIAT students? and (3) To what extent do positive engineering identity and self-efficacy serve as factors in participation and persistence of low-income academically talented students in engineering graduate degrees? Research questions will be addressed using student recruitment and retention data, program surveys, and interviews. An external evaluator will work with the project team to provide formative and summative assessments of yearly program outcomes. Overall, the project is expected to fill the gap in knowledge generation on the role of self-efficacy and engineering identity among undergraduate students who continue to pursue engineering through graduate degree attainment. Project findings will be presented to the STEM education and engineering communities and contribute to the knowledge base about what works for whom in retention, student success, and graduation in graduate-level engineering programs. This project is funded by NSF???s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.
Collaborative Research: SCALE MoDL: Advancing Theoretical Minimax Deep Learning: Optimization, Resilience, and Interpretability;;2021;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The past decade has witnessed the great success of deep learning in broad societal and commercial applications. However, conventional deep learning relies on fitting data with neural networks, which is known to produce models that lack resilience. For instance, models used in autonomous driving are vulnerable to malicious attacks, e.g., putting an art sticker on a stop sign can cause the model to classify it as a speed limit sign; models used in facial recognition are known to be biased toward people of a certain race or gender; models in healthcare can be hacked to reconstruct the identities of patients that are used in training those models. The next-generation deep learning paradigm needs to deliver resilient models that promote robustness to malicious attacks, fairness among users, and privacy preservation. This project aims to develop a comprehensive learning theory to enhance the model resilience of deep learning. The project will produce fast algorithms and new diagnostic tools for training, enhancing, visualizing, and interpreting model resilience, all of which can have broad research and societal significance. The research activities will also generate positive educational impacts on undergraduate and graduate students. The materials developed by this project will be integrated into courses on machine learning, statistics, and data visualization and will benefit interdisciplinary students majoring in electrical and computer engineering, statistics, mathematics, and computer science. The project will actively involve underrepresented students and integrate research with education for undergraduate and graduate students in STEM. It will also produce introductory materials for K-12 students to be used in engineering summer camps. In this project, the investigators will collaboratively develop a comprehensive minimax learning theory that advances the fundamental understanding of minimax deep learning from the perspectives of optimization, resilience, and interpretability. These complementary theoretical developments, in turn, will guide the design of novel minimax learning algorithms with substantially improved computational efficiency, statistical guarantees, and interpretability. The research includes three major thrusts. First, the investigators will develop a principled non-convex minimax optimization theory that supports scalable, fast, and convergent gradient-descent-ascent algorithms for training complex minimax deep learning models. The theory will focus on analyzing the convergence rate and sample complexity of the developed algorithms. Second, the investigators will formulate a measure of vulnerability of deep learning models and study how minimaxity can enhance their resilience against data, model, and task deviations. This theory will focus on the statistical limits of deep learning. Lastly, the investigators will establish the mathematical foundations for a set of novel visual analytics techniques that increase the model interpretability of minimax learning. In particular, the theory will provide guidance on visualizing and interpreting model resilience. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and Applications: Promoting Scientific Discoveries, Technological Advances, and STEM Education;;2012;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"The Center for Research and Education in Optical Sciences and Applications (CREOSA) was established at Delaware State University in 2006 as a NSF Center of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST). The Phase II Center will build on accomplishments of the first 6 years of the program, with a continued focus on optical sciences and applied physics. The CREOSA has been leading systemic and transformative educational, research, and outreach programs at Delaware State University, a Historically Black University. A new doctoral program in Optics has been initiated (the only one at an HBCU), leveraged the CREST award to secure funds for construction of a new building dedicated to optics research, increased scholarly publications by a factor of 6, enabled the hiring of 9 new faculty members, licensed the first intellectual property for DSU, and provided graduate student training of a new generation of optical scientists, mostly from minority groups. The Center also was instrumental in creating a culture of innovative integration to foster interdepartmental and multidisciplinary research and education at DSU. The continued support by the NSF for CREOSA has enable Delaware State to achieve national prominence in optical sciences while serving the minority population of students that will attend and will be drawn to DSU. Center Vision CREOSA will be a sustainable unit that seeks to achieve national prominence in research and education in optical sciences with a strong commitment to educate, train, and prepare traditionally underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Center Mission CREOSA will integrate multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches to (1) Perform cutting-edge research in optical sciences; (2) Provide world-class education in optical sciences with a focus on serving historically underrepresented groups in STEM; (3) Improve the research infrastructure in optical sciences at DSU; and (4) Enhance significantly the diversity of the workforce with backgrounds in optical sciences by broadening participation of underrepresented groups in research and education at all levels which includes the population groups from K-12, undergraduate, graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and faculty. Intellectual Merit CREOSA will exploit the interdisciplinary nature of research activities across fields of optics, biology, biochemistry, mathematics and computational sciences. Three research subprojects form the foundation of the Center's research and educational activities: 1. Spectroscopy and Imaging of Biomacromolecules in Crowded and Complex Media This subproject brings together optical sciences and biological sciences at the technological cutting edge. The research has the potential to attain unprecedented limits for the accurate detection, identification, and classification of diverse bio-macromolecules in their host environments. These biomolecules may serve as novel biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of various diseases and are the key idea behind the rapidly developing research in the field of nanomedicine. 2. Spin Polarization Spectrosopy in Nanodiamond for Nanoscale Sensing and Imaging The subproject team will investigate spectroscopic methods of studying nanoscale materials. The work complements the activity of the first subproject, in that it will provide avenues to probe single and/or complex biomacromolecules. These materials may provide an important driver in the development of solid-state quantum information processing. 3. A System for Interactive Data Mining in Experimental Optics This subproject will link experimental optics with important elements of data mining. The research proposed in both of the first two subprojects will create a large amount of complex data, which will require an integrated approach in which data-driven machine learning techniques are coupled with idealized models and expert knowledge in the analysis of spectroscopic data. The techniques to be developed will help resolve the communication bottleneck that occurs when several scientists in multidisciplinary optics research collaborate and exchange experimental data and extracted information. Broader Impacts More than 65% of the students at Delaware State are African American, and the new doctoral program established from the Phase I award is an important resource for that population, both in terms of advanced graduate programs and as a model for the role of research in stimulating more students from underrepresented groups to pursue STEM degrees. A partnership with the Fisk-Vanderbilt doctoral bridge program has been initiated, which will stimulate pathways IN BOTH DIRECTIONS for these institutions. An active professional development program for graduate students will be initiated, concurrent with a well organized recruitment and mentoring activities. The program will also be at the heart of recruitment efforts for undergraduate students to matriculate in STEM fields at DSU and from URM groups in Delaware elsewhere, because of the high visibility of the optical sciences program. DSU will continue outreach activities for pre-college students and the general community, such as a summer program that has prepared 89 students from 23 universities during the first five years, sponsorship of events such as open houses for the Delaware Science Alliance and Physics Days. The project will continue the enhancement of the curriculum at DSU, across several academic platforms. These include new tracks in electrical engineering, optical engineering, and bio-engineering in the Department of Physics and Pre-Engineering, as well as updates to the curricula for physics and physics education. New educational laboratories will be developed as part of the world-class imaging facilities that are part of a new building being constructed. The research investigations have the potential for profound impact on human health and counterterrorism. The work will provide a stronger scientific foundation that could yield new technologies for medical diagnostics of early signs of disease and to detect pathogens used to fight bio-terrorism. This award has been partially funded through the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research at the National Science Foundation."
PIRE: Building Decarbonization via AI-empowered District Heat Pump Systems;;2023;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Increasing concerns about climate change, clean energy, and energy security demand that our society transition to a net-zero carbon economy that serves the triple bottom line of planetary health, societal well-being, and economic prosperity. This PIRE project is focused on innovating Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with an understanding of human need and behaviors to enable an efficient, human-centered, resilient, and socially justifiable operation of district- and community-scale heat pumps systems that promote a regional scale adoption of building decarbonization. In an increasingly urbanized world, there is a pressing need to address the critical challenges of climate change through the built environment because the building sector accounts for nearly 40% of the primary energy use in the U.S. and associated greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions, with about 50% of that energy dedicated to heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting. In addition, people spend more than 90% of their time indoors which means that addressing their needs and comfort in a sustainable way is critical for climate resilience planning. Electrification of heating and cooling systems is widely acknowledged as a core and non-negotiable strategy for decarbonization. Many major U.S. metropolitan areas have put the adoption of electric heat pump technologies on the roadmap reaching building decarbonization in the next decade. Taking advantage of the wide adoption of district heating/cooling heat pump systems in Nordic countries, this project seeks to leverage the data and testbeds provided by our core international partners from Sweden and Denmark and the AI innovations provided by the U.S. team to catalyze the readiness to support the scaling up and adoption of human-centered and equity focused AI empowered district system operation strategies at a regional and global scale. Findings from this project will be disseminated through two International Energy Agency???s Annex teams (81 and 84) which will reach to researchers from more than 20 countries. Through their outreach activities, including focus group discussions and workshops, the team will work closely with partners from government and community stakeholders to promote community-focused and equitable district heat pump adoption, implementation, and operation. Two new cross-institutional education programs are designed to promote convergent international education in human centered sustainable built environment: a) Summer International Graduate Bootcamp and Exchange Program; and b) Smart Built Environment Certification Program. Leveraging partner institutions??? other existing flagship programs ranging from K-12, undergraduate, and workforce training, the project will train a diverse, convergent workforce well-versed in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), AI, and socioeconomics to tackle global challenges of climate change. This project contributes to: 1) data science ??? the development of new human-interactive AI tools to help facility managers and building owners (i.e., users) to make timely decisions and to help incentivize a faster and wider adoption of building decarbonization; 2) building science ??? the development of novel and scalable models and algorithms for occupant-centric and socially equitable controls driven by occupant, environmental, and community needs; and 3) social science ??? engaging communities and decision-makers in the design of AI systems to incorporate their environmental, social, economic, and equity needs in the models. Specific anticipated engineering/science contributions include: 1) novel causally-informed Bayesian network with dynamic causal discovery and thermography-based big data analysis for a scalable performance monitoring, energy diagnosis, and prognosis of district heat pump systems, 2) a comprehensive AI learning based occupant needs and behavior modeling framework to bridge the gaps within human-building-community interactions and promote energy equity across the district, 3) new physics- and data-informed learning models for forecasting and optimization under uncertainty, and 4) holistic data sets collected from pilot sites in Sweden/Denmark and the U.S. that use an energy justice lens and are developed through a community-informed approach. The project team's international industry partners, including a heat pump manufacturer and district energy system management companies, will guide the project to streamline the potential technology transfer process. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CAREER: All-Acoustic Image-Guided Implantable Microscopic Ultrasound Neuromodulation;;2020;;Awarded Grant;WoS;;;;;Yes;"Neuromodulation has the potential to map neural functions; enhance our perceptual, motor, and cognitive capabilities; and restore sensory and motor functions lost through injury or disease. Despite several decades of research and development, state-of-the-art noninvasive neuromodulation techniques still suffer from poor spatial resolution (more than several millimeters), while implantable electrical and optical methods with finer spatial resolution only provide a limited coverage of hundreds to thousands of neurons through extremely invasive parenchymal implantation. These limitations are fundamental, and further optimization of these technologies cannot simultaneously meet the critical requirements of minimal invasiveness, microscopic spatial resolution (hundreds of micrometers and below), and whole brain coverage. This program includes scientific research in a radical approach that explores ultrasound, which has already been effective in transcranial neuromodulation with sub-centimeter resolution, as a minimally invasive implantable means for unprecedented microscopic-resolution neuromodulation at large scale. The proposed research will yield a unique building block for a comprehensive set of minimally invasive neural interfaces. It will open new opportunities in neuroscience with significant improvements in spatial resolution and coverage of neuromodulation of the brain, initially in animals. Ultimately, it will also have huge translational potential for many clinical applications in humans, such as the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders and brain-machine interfaces. Leveraging the multidisciplinary nature of the research, this program also includes an integrated outreach and educational component created around a Troubleshooting and Inquiry-based Learning (TIL) Framework to enhance students' learning of principles and research skills at different education levels. Transforming an undergraduate circuit course with the TIL framework will enhance the research skills, problem solving, and creative thinking of many undergraduate students. An annual week-long summer workshop for teachers with educational TIL-based hands-on and in-class computer-game-based modules will educate K-12 teachers and their students from districts underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in this research. A TIL-based Ultrasonically Transferred Song hands-on module for pre-college female students will attract them to the engineering profession and educate them in this research. A new medical-device course will educate graduate students in this field. This program will explore implantable microscopic ultrasound stimulation (IuUS) with minimally invasive modulation of the whole brain with the spatial resolution of hundreds of micrometers and below. This program will establish the fundamental basis for IuUS, in which an ultrasound transducer array is implanted on the brain surface (partially removed skull) with no parenchymal penetration to electronically steer highly focused ultrasound beams towards different neural targets. Such a system can be utilized in basic neuroscience experiments to address the most fundamental scientific questions in ultrasound neuromodulation: underlying mechanism, efficacy, and safety. This work will explore and establish vibro-acoustography for high energy efficiency in IuUS. It will investigate fundamental limits of spatial resolution and coverage as well as energy efficiency in IuUS by developing numerical and computational models based on wave equations to explore effects of different transducer geometries, frequencies, and configurations as well as their interactions with tissue and electronics. To manage post-implantation uncertainties (e.g. micromotions), this work will explore and create a learning-based all-acoustic image-guided system for accurate anatomical targeting. An on-chip machine-learning model with offline training will be developed to dynamically map changes in the profile of acoustic beams to micromotions and tissue changes in a fast and accurate fashion. An inductively interrogated closed-loop (recording and stimulation) system-on-chip with novel circuitry will also be developed for IuUS. Finally, a system-level demonstration will establish the fundamental basis for IuUS. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
Investigating dialogic interaction in K12 online one-on-one mathematics tutoring using AI and sequence mining techniques;Wang, Deliang and Shan, Dapeng and Ju, Ran and Kao, Ben and Zhang, Chenwei and Chen, Gaowei;2024;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-024-13195-9;;;Yes;Yes;Online one-on-one tutoring serves as a supplementary approach to traditional classroom instruction. It has been shown to enhance personalized learning and academic performance. However, the dynamics of dialogic interactions within this educational setting are not fully understood. Thus, we present a computational analysis of dialogic interactions in online one-on-one mathematics tutoring. Specifically, we devised a coding scheme tailored to online tutoring sessions and leveraged advanced artificial intelligence techniques to construct an automated model for annotating dialog acts. We then investigated the basic characteristics and interaction patterns in a dataset encompassing online one-on-one tutoring dialogs within K-12 mathematics education and obtained insightful findings. First, tutors were found to often apply both didactic and other effective teaching strategies. Second, off-task chatting accounted for a significant proportion of tutoring sessions. Third, high school students exhibited greater engagement and cognitive abilities than primary and middle school students through their more active participation and superior reasoning skills. Primary school students, despite their less active participation, responded positively when engaged by tutors. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing strategies applied by tutors and students to create a more dynamic and effective learning environment and provide valuable insights into the nature of online one-on-one tutoring.
