What Would the Matrix Do?: A Systematic Review of K-12 AI Learning Contexts and Learner-Interface Interactions;"Moore, Robert L.; Jiang, Shiyan; Abramowitz, Brian";2023;Journal of Research on Technology in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1080/15391523.2022.2148785;This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence's instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synThesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration.
ML4STEM Professional Development Program: Enriching K-12 STEM Teaching with Machine Learning;"Tang, Jingwan; Zhou, Xiaofei; Wan, Xiaoyu; Daley, Michael; Bai, Zhen";2023;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00292-4;The advances of machine learning (ML) in scientific discovery (SD) reveal exciting opportunities to utilize it as a cross-cutting tool for inquiry-based learning in K-12 STEM classrooms. There are, however, limited efforts on providing teachers with sufficient knowledge and skills to integrate ML into teaching. Our study addresses this gap by proposing a professional development (PD) program named ML4STEM. Based on existing research on supporting teacher learning in innovative technology integration, ML4STEM is composed of Teachers-as-Learners and Teachers-as-Designers sessions. It integrates an accessible ML learning platform designed for students with limited math and computing skills. We implemented this PD program and evaluated its effectiveness with 18 K-12 STEM teachers. Findings confirm that ML4STEM successfully develops teachers' understanding of teaching STEM with ML as well as fosters positive attitudes toward applying the ML as an in-class teaching technology. Discussions on the implications of our findings from ML4STEM are provided for future PD researchers and designers.
Integrating Machine Learning in Mathematics Classrooms;Jones, Joshua;2021;Mathematics Teacher: Learning and Teaching PK-12;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.5951/MTLT.2021.0001;"Aside from being culturally relevant, artificial intelligence is also supporting companies in making business decisions. Consequently, ""workforce needs have shifted rapidly,"" resulting in a demand for applicants who are skilled in ""data, analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence"" (Miller and Hughes 2017). This article contributes to filling that need by exploring a lesson in which students learned how conditional probability is the crux of many machine learning algorithms, including predictive text applications. Prior to this lesson, students learned how to calculate conditional probability. Most students had also demonstrated that they were able to calculate experimental probabilities on the basis of a Venn diagram, on a word problem, and on a two-way table. The activity described in this article satisfies Common Core State Standard CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSS. CP.A.5."
Personalized Online Learning, Test Fairness, and Educational Measurement: Considering Differential Content Exposure Prior to a High Stakes End of Course Exam;"Katz, Daniel; Huggins-Manley, Anne Corinne; Leite, Walter";2022;Applied Measurement in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1080/08957347.2022.2034824;"According to the ""Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing"" (2014), one aspect of test fairness concerns examinees having comparable opportunities to learn prior to taking tests. Meanwhile, many researchers are developing platforms enhanced by artificial intelligence (AI) that can personalize curriculum to individual student needs. This leads to a larger overarching question: When personalized learning leads to students having differential exposure to curriculum throughout the K-12 school year, how might this affect test fairness with respect to summative, end-of-year high-stakes tests? As a first step, we traced the differences in content exposure associated with personalized learning and more traditional learning paths. To better understand the implications of differences in content coverage, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate the degree to which curriculum exposure varied across students in a particular AI-enhanced learning platform for Algebra instruction with high-school students. Results indicate that AI-enhanced personalized learning may pose threats to test fairness as opportunity-to-learn on K-12 summative high-stakes tests. We discuss the implications given different perspectives of the role of testing in education"

The goal of this review is to add to the conversation by offering a complete overview of AI in mathematics teaching and learning for students at all levels of education. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using established and robust guidelines. We follow the preferred Reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). We searched ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer Link, ProQuest, and EBSCO Host for 20 AI studies published between 2017 and 2021. The findings of the SLR indicate that AI approach used in mathematics education forthe samples studied were through robotics, systems, tools, teachable agent, autonomous agent, and a comprehensive approach. Then, it can be shown that the majority of the collected studies were carried out in the USA and Mexico. The analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies used quantitative research methods. The types of themes for AI in mathematics education were categorized into advantages and disadvantages, conceptual understanding, factors, role, idea suggestion, strategies and effectiveness.
The Effect of AI-Based Systems on Mathematics Achievement in Rural Context: A Quantitative Study;"Khazanchi, Rashmi; Mitri, Daniele Di; Drachsler, Hendrik";2025;Journal of Computer Assisted Learning;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/jcal.13098;Background: Despite educational advances, poor mathematics achievement persists among K-12 students, particularly in rural areas with limited resources and skilled teachers. Artificial Intelligence (AI) based systems have increasingly been adopted to support the diverse learning needs of students and have been shown to enhance mathematics achievement through personalized learning experiences by adapting to student's needs. Existing studies have documented the positive impact of AI-based systems on mathematics achievement. However, there is a lack of research that has studied AI-based systems on students' mathematics achievement and engagement in rural settings. The present study addresses the existing literature gap by focusing on the AI-based Edmentum Exact Path, analyzing its effectiveness in enhancing mathematics achievement and engagement among 8th-grade students in rural schools in the Southern United States. By examining both cognitive and affective engagement, along with students' mathematics achievement, this research explores the role of AI-based systems in student learning. Objective: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of Edmentum Exact Path, an AI-based system, in improving 8th-grade students' mathematics achievement and affective and cognitive engagement in the Southern United States. Methods: This study utilized a quasi-experimental design involving 78 students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds, comparing those receiving supplemental Edmentum Exact Path-led instruction and traditional teacher-led methods to a control group receiving only the teacher-led instructions. Mathematics achievement was measured through pre-tests and post-tests, while student engagement was assessed using the 5-point Student Engagement Instrument (SEI). Statistical analysis was performed using t-tests and ANOVA. Results and Conclusions: The findings revealed statistically significant improvements in mathematics achievement for both the experimental and control groups. However, the group using teacher-led instruction showed a statistically significant improvement in affective engagement, while no statistically significant differences were observed in cognitive engagement between groups. Implications: The findings suggest that integrating AI-based systems like Edmentum Exact Path may enhance affective engagement in mathematics among students from rural areas. However, the impact on cognitive engagement remains unclear, indicating a need for further research. These results support the potential for integrating AI-based systems to enhance mathematics achievement in rural settings.
Cultural Integration in AI-Enhanced Mathematics Education: Insights from Southeast Asian Educators;"Payadnya, I. Putu Ade Andre; Putri, Gusti Ayu Made Arna; Suwija, I. Ketut; Saelee, Sompob; Jayantika, I. Gusti Agung Ngurah Trisna";2025;Journal for Multicultural Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1108/JME-09-2024-0119;Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in education, yet its cultural impact, especially in Southeast Asian mathematics education, remains underexplored. This gap is significant because understanding cultural adaptation is essential for AI tools to effectively enhance learning in diverse classrooms. This study examines how AI can be integrated into mathematics education across Southeast Asia, focusing on specific cultural practices such as communal learning styles, respect for hierarchical structures and the role of local languages, as well as educators' perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative data from questionnaires with qualitative insights from interviews with educators across ten Southeast Asian countries. The study included 543 respondents in total with the numbers is varying in each country, targeting high school teachers experienced in using AI in teaching. Findings: The findings revealed that educators in Singapore are most confident in AI's adaptability to cultural contexts, whereas those in Myanmar and Laos face challenges due to infrastructure limitations. Interviews highlighted the need to customize AI tools to align with students' cultural backgrounds, including language preferences and traditional learning practices, for effective implementation. Teacher training and access to technology, especially in rural areas, were also identified as critical factors. Originality/value: This study addresses a critical gap in understanding AI's cultural implications in Southeast Asia, providing insights into how cultural values, language and educational practices influence the integration of AI in mathematics education. The findings highlight the need for culturally responsive AI tools and targeted improvements in infrastructure and teacher training for successful implementation.
Introducing Students to Machine Learning with Decision Trees Using CODAP and Jupyter NoteBooks;"Biehler, Rolf; Fleischer, Yannik";2021;Teaching Statistics: An International  Journal for Teachers;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/test.12279;"This paper Reports on progress in the development of a teaching module on machine learning with decision trees for secondary-school students, in which students use survey data about media use to predict who plays online games frequently. This context is familiar to students and provides a link between school and everyday experience. In this module, they use CODAP's ""Arbor"" plug-in to manually build decision trees and understand how to systematically build trees based on data. Further on, the students use a menu-based environment in a Jupyter NoteBook to apply an algorithm that automatically generates decision trees and to evaluate and optimize the performance of these. Students acquire technical and conceptual skills but also reflect on personal and social aspects of the uses of algorithms from machine learning."
ALEKS in High School Mathematics Classrooms: Exploring Teachers' Perceptions and Use of This Tool;"Kumor, Tristan; Uribe-Flórez, Lida; Trespalacios, Jesús; Yang, Dazhi";2024;TechTrends: Linking Research and Practice to Improve Learning;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11528-024-00955-0;There has been a limited amount of research that has attempted to determine teaching strategies using adaptive learning systems. Most studies have attempted to measure success of the use of these technologies based on improvements in students' test scores but have lacked to provide any information regarding the pedagogy implemented while using the tool or teachers' perceptions of it. A basic qualitative study was conducted where five Chicagoland high school mathematics teachers, who used the Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) system, were interviewed three times during one academic school year. This study asked participants to share first-hand experiences and perceptions of using ALEKS as the main learning tool. Teachers used ALEKS for assessing student understanding through its quizzes and assignments, analyzing student progress, and allowing students to practice and receive feedback on mathematical concepts. The findings of this study indicate that teachers found ALEKS to be easy to use and useful in their teaching. Specifically, teachers cited the assessment tools, built-in feedback, ability to personalize learning, and the accessibility of learning tools for students as useful in their teaching.
AI ChatBots' Solutions to Mathematical Problems in Interactive E-TextBooks: Affordances and Constraints from the Eyes of Students and Teachers;"Ergene, Ozkan; Ergene, Busra Caylan";2025;Education and Information Technologies;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-024-13121-z;One of the aims of the present study was to reveal and compare the performance of ChatGPT versions (GPT-4o, GPT-4, and GPT-3.5), MathGPT, and Gemini in solving 390 mathematical problems in interactive mathematics e-textBooks across various dimensions. The other aim was to identify the affordances and constraints of ChatGPT through the instrumental approach. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. The participants were 160 high school students and 80 mathematics teachers. Data were collected through the evaluation forms, view forms, and interviews with students and teachers based on ChatGPT's solutions to the mathematical problems. The findings showed that the success rates of GPT-4o and GPT-4 were close to each other, with a slightly higher success rate of GPT-4o. This was followed by MathGPT and GPT-3.5. Gemini has the lowest success rate among the AI chatbots. Depending on the complexity of the mathematical problems, a statistically significant difference between the number of correct and incorrect solutions was found in all ChatGPT versions but not in MathGPT and Gemini. Furthermore, teachers and students referred to explanatory and detailed aspects of the solutions, learning without a teacher, getting solutions directly and quickly, and learning support as affordances of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the participants also acknowledged the constraints of ChatGPT while being aware of its affordances. Based on students' and teachers' expressions in the view forms and interviews, the mean scores they provided in the evaluation forms, and ChatGPT's high performance in solving mathematical problems, it is suggested that ChatGPT could be a useful tool for students' individual mathematics learning process.
"""Gea2"": A Serious Game for Technology-Enhanced Learning in STEM";"Ferro, Lauren S.; Sapio, Francesco; Terracina, Annalisa; Temperini, Marco; Mecella, Massimo";2021;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2022.3143519;Education and training are among the fields taking advantage of serious games (SGs). In this article, we present Gea 2: A New Earth, a digital SG developed as an immersive 3-D virtual learning environment, integrating several educational resources, including multimedia learning material, communication tools, and intelligent tutoring support. The game aims to complement traditional classroom activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), for high school students and teachers. It incorporates an intelligent pedagogical agent that can converse in natural language with the student and provides unsolicited hints during gameplay. This article presents the game and its evaluation based on experiments involving about 100 participants. We think that the results presented here add to the research on game-based learning for STEM, by proposing a complex game system, where artificial intelligence techniques are integrated to support students' learning, and by confirming that the game experience can be attractive for the learners, also in very constrained classroom environments, such as those we operated in.
Examining Key Capitals Contributing to Students' Science-Related Career Expectations and Their Relationship Patterns: A Machine Learning Approach;"Tan, Lihua; Chen, Fu; Wei, Bing";2024;Journal of Research in Science Teaching;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21939;"Through the lens of science capital, this research aims to detect the key factors and their main effects in identifying students with science-related career expectations. A machine learning approach (i.e., random forest) was employed to analyze a dataset of 519,334 15-year-old students from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015. The global analysis identified 25 key factors out of 88 contextual features: (1) for ""how you think,"" making students feel science is relevant, enjoyable, and interesting is relatively more crucial than being ambitious and confident; (2) for ""what science you know,"" students' science and math literacy, epistemological beliefs, and awareness of environmental matters were the key factors; (3) for ""who you know,"" parents valuing science, expecting their children to enter science, and providing emotional support were as similar as or even more important than their economic, social, and cultural status (ESCS)-related constructs, while teachers fairness ranked the top among all teaching-related features; and (4) for ""what you do,"" appropriate science learning time, engagement in science activities, and ICT use for schoolwork were key factors. These findings indicate a relatively optimistic situation, as the most key capitals were malleable for educators. Accumulated local effect plots further discriminated how these key capitals related to students' career expectations in four distinct ways: ""increasing,"" ""S-shaped,"" ""inverted-U-shaped,"" and ""decreasing,"" shedding light on how we could optimize key resources to enhance aspirations. The comparison between global and Hong Kong analyses suggests the key factors identified by the global model were generally effective but not necessarily essential for a specific region. The cross-cultural generalizability or prevalence of capitals might vary by their forms."
What Makes Tablet-Based Learning Effective? A Study of the Role of Real-Time Adaptive Feedback;"Colliot, Tiphaine; Krichen, Omar; Girard, Nathalie; Anquetil, Éric; Jamet, Éric";2024;British Journal of Educational Technology;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13439;This study investigated the added value of real-time adaptive feedback on seventh graders' performances in tablet-based geometry learning. To isolate the effects of the medium (ie, tablet) from those of the feedback, three groups were compared: paper-and-pencil, pen-based tablet without feedback and pen-based tablet with feedback. The feedback was provided by a tutoring system based on an artificial intelligence that automatically interpreted students' pen strokes on the screen. A total of 85 French students drew three geometric shapes, either on paper or on a tablet, and then performed a transfer task on paper. Results showed that using a tablet without feedback did not improve learning but seemed to enhance interest in the task compared to the paper-and-pencil group. Students in the tablet with feedback group performed significantly better than the other two groups on learning, as well as on transfer. This study was the first to combine media comparison and added-value approaches to test the effects on students' geometry performances of using a new educational app on a pen-based tablet in a naturalistic classroom environment. Results showed that it was not the medium used but the intelligent tutoring system-based feedback that improved students' performance. Our data therefore indicate that artificial intelligence is a promising way of providing learners with real-time adaptive feedback in order to improve their performances.
Revolutionizing Pre-Calculus Education: Photomath's AI-Powered Mathematics Tutorship;Capinding, Andie Tangonan;2023;Problems of Education in the 21st Century;Article;Eric;;"Mathematics plays a vital role in education; however, Filipino students encounter difficulties, evident in their performance on both national and international assessments. However, current literature suggests that leveraging technology, such as calculators and AI, in mathematics education can enhance students' proficiency, particularly in the pre-calculus domain. Thus, this research study examined the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing Filipino students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. A quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design was used, with 49 Grade 11 students from NEUST Laboratory High School participating. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed to examine the pre-and post-intervention data. Results revealed a significant increase in students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus following the use of Photomath. The mean scores on all three measures increased significantly from the pretest to the posttest. The results of the t-tests further confirmed the effectiveness of Photomath in enhancing students' self-reliance, interest, and performance in pre-calculus. These results suggest that Photomath can be a valuable tool for educators to incorporate into pre-calculus teaching to enhance students' confidence and interest, foster intrinsic motivation, and ultimately improve their performance."
Three Algorithms for Grouping Students: A Bridge between Personalized Tutoring System Data and Classroom Pedagogy;"Lechuga, Christopher G.; Doroudi, Shayan";2023;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-022-00309-y;Computer-assisted instructional programs such as intelligent tutoring systems are often used to support blended learning practices in K-12 education, as they aim to meet individual student needs with personalized instruction. While these systems have been shown to be effective under certain conditions, they can be difficult to integrate into pedagogical practices. In this paper, we introduce three group formation algorithms that leverage learning data from the adaptive intelligent tutoring system ALEKS to support pedagogical and collaborative learning practices with ALEKS. Each grouping method was devised for different use cases, but they all utilize a fine-grained multidimensional view of student ability measured across several hundred skills in an academic course. As such, the grouping algorithms not only identify groups of students, but they also determine what areas of ALEKS content each group should focus on. We then evaluate each of the three methods against two alternative baseline methods, which were chosen for their plausibility of being used in practice--one that groups students randomly and one that groups students based on a unidimensional course score. To evaluate these methods, we establish a set of practical metrics based on what we anticipate teachers would care about in practice. Evaluations were performed by simulating mock groupings of students at different time periods for real ALEKS algebra classes that occurred between 2017 and 2019. We show that each devised method obtains more favorable results on the specified metrics than the alternative methods under each use-case. Moreover, we highlight examples where our methods lead to more nuanced groupings than grouping based on a unidimensional measure of ability.
Indonesian Students' Perceptions towards AI-Based Learning in Mathematics;"Soesanto, Robert Harry; Dirgantoro, Kurnia Putri Sepdikasari; Priyantim, Neng";2022;Journal on Mathematics Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.22342/jme.v13i3.pp531-548;The pandemic has indeed provided students and teachers worldwide with the experience of technology-infused teaching. Even though the pandemic is almost over, the utilization of technology in mathematics education is still needed and inseparable. Relying on cross-sectional design and phenomenological approach, this research investigates senior high school students' perceptions towards AI-based learning, particularly about their understanding and suggestions towards AI-based learning in mathematics in the context of post-pandemic. The participants of the study were 107 students coming from several islands in Indonesia, ranging from grade 10-12, with an age interval of 15-18 years old. The instruments used were the questionaries with open-ended questions in Microsoft forms distributed to mathematics teachers in several WhatsApp groups. The data were then analyzed through a multistage descriptive and pattern coding process. The findings showed that students need to be facilitated with AI, which can display understandable visualization and provide guidance to solve mathematical problems. It is expected that the present study's findings offer researchers in Indonesia and abroad to disseminate and/or implement AI learning in the form of Intelligent Tutoring Systems.
Combining Machine Translation and Automated Scoring in International Large-Scale Assessments;"Jung, Ji Yoon; Tyack, Lillian; Davier, Matthias von";2024;Large-scale Assessments in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1186/s40536-024-00199-7;Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing communication and technology-driven content creation and is also being used more frequently in education. Despite these advancements, AI-powered automated scoring in international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) remains largely unexplored due to the scoring challenges associated with processing large amounts of multilingual responses. However, due to their low-stakes nature, ILSAs are an ideal ground for innovations and exploring new methodologies. Methods: This study proposes combining state-of-the-art machine translations (i.e., Google Translate & ChatGPT) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mitigate two key concerns of human scoring: inconsistency and high expense. We applied AI-based automated scoring to multilingual student responses from eight countries and six different languages, using six constructed response items from TIMSS 2019. Results: Automated scoring displayed comparable performance to human scoring, especially when the ANNs were trained and tested on ChatGPT-translated responses. Furthermore, psychometric characteristics derived from machine scores generally exhibited similarity to those obtained from human scores. These results can be considered as supportive evidence for the validity of automated scoring for survey assessments. Conclusions: This study highlights that automated scoring integrated with the recent machine translation holds great promise for consistent and resource-efficient scoring in ILSAs.
Meta-Affective Behaviour within an Intelligent Tutoring System for Mathematics;"Rebolledo-Mendez, Genaro; Huerta-Pacheco, N. Sofia; Baker, Ryan S.; du Boulay, Benedict";2022;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;Article;Eric;https://doi.org/10.1007/s40593-021-00247-1;Many previous studies have highlighted the influence of learners' affective states on learning with tutoring systems. However, the associations between learning and learners' meta-affective capability are still unclear. The goal of this paper is to analyse meta-affective capability and its influence on learning outcomes as well as the dynamics of affect over time. Two criteria, awareness and self-regulation, were employed to define meta-affective capability. An exploratory study (n = 54) was conducted in which students at the secondary level were asked to interact with an intelligent tutoring system for mathematics and to self-Report their affect during their interactions with the system. Pre-post learning outcomes were also measured. A post-hoc comparison of learning gains was made between more meta-affectively capable and less meta-affectively capable students. The results provide some empirical evidence to support the hypoThesis that having meta-affective capability is positively associated with learning. Students not demonstrating meta-affective capability seemed to transition frequently from boredom to frustration (p = 0.0284) and from concentration to neutral (p = 0.0017). However, only a small percentage of the sample were classified as having meta-affective capability, indicating that it is important to scaffold students who are not meta-affectively capable.
The Development of Individualized Assignment Generator;"R. R. Zaripova; A. V. Danilov; L. L. Salekhova; T. R. Fazliakhmetov";2024;2024 17th International Conference on Development in eSystem Engineering (DeSE);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/DeSE63988.2024.10911947;The article discusses the development of a system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate individualized mathematics assignments for bilingual students in Tatarstan, Russia. The goal is to enhance learning by tailoring assignments to students’ linguistic preferences, cognitive styles, and knowledge levels. The system employs machine learning techniques and GPT-based models to create personalized tasks that align with curriculum goals while addressing linguistic diversity, particularly for Tatar-Russian bilinguals. The study evaluates several large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, YandexGPT, and GigaChat, based on their ability to generate math problems and content in the Tatar language. While GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo show superior performance in producing accurate and semantically correct problems, their proficiency in Tatar remains inconsistent. The research underscores the need for further development of LLMs to enhance content generation for bilingual educational contexts and highlights the potential of AI in advancing adaptive learning for mathematics education. Future directions include expanding the system’s functionality and testing its effectiveness across diverse educational settings.
Primary and High School Question Classification based on Bloom's Taxonomy;"Hasmawati; A. Romadhony; R. Abdurohman";2022;2022 10th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/ICoICT55009.2022.9914842;One of the student's abilities that must be measured in the learning process is cognitive ability. This measurement is essential to establish the level of students' understanding of the material that has been taught. Giving questions with the appropriate difficulty level is an attempt to measure these cognitive abilities. According to Bloom's taxonomy, there are six levels of cognitive abilities, remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. An automatic question classifier is helpful for teachers to develop a high-quality question and comply with different cognitive levels. This paper proposed automation question classification using the classical classification method (Support Vector Machine and Multinomial Naïve Bayes) and the pre-trained language model, IndoBERT. We conducted an experiment based on 670 mathematics and Indonesian language questions in primary and high school. The evaluation results show that the best classification accuracy was achieved by the IndoBERT method, which is 82% for classifying mathematics questions and 63% for classifying Indonesian Language questions. We analyzed that the small number of datasets and unbalanced at each taxonomy level affected the classification results.
Diagnosing Mathematical Procedures in Number and Algebra Strand of 7th Students using the Machine Learning Platform for Khon Kaen University demonstration secondary school (Suksasart);"M. Prasertsang; M. Marwiang; P. Junpeng";2024;2024 International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers, and Communications (ITC-CSCC);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/ITC-CSCC62988.2024.10628212;Diagnosing students' mathematical proficiency is a challenging task for teachers, as using technology such as machine learning together with mathematical procedures is an interesting approach to diagnose the mathematical proficiency of Grade 7 students. The objective of this research was to diagnose the levels of mathematical proficiency in the dimensions of mathematical procedures, number, and algebra strand for Grade 7 students, using a design research methodology. The findings indicate that most students, 79%, have a good foundation of knowledge, concepts, and basic skills, ready to learn supplementary smart lessons. However, they still have misconceptions and gaps in interpreting language and symbols, and lack understanding of fundamental math concepts, which makes it difficult for them to solve basic or multi-step word problems.
Learning with Explainable AI-Recommendations at School: Extracting Patterns of Self-Directed Learning from Learning Logs;"R. Majumdar; K. Takami; H. Ogata";2023;2023 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/ICALT58122.2023.00078;Educational explainable AI (XAI) applications are gaining research focus and have distinct needs in the domain of Education. This research presents Educational eXplainable AI Tool (EXAIT), a system for math quiz recommendations, along with an explanation. EXAIT was implemented in a Japanese public high school where students received the top 5 math problems based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm in a learning analytics dashboard. It aimed to help them complete their summer vacation assignments having 240 questions. On click, the students were redirected to an eBook platform to submit their accuracy and confidence level in each problem. We conducted a study with a quasi-experimental design and divided into 3 groups based on compliance of use. RecoExp group received and used explanations regarding why an item was recommended and how it aims to maximize learners' knowledge-gaining path. RecoCon was the control group that received just the recommendations and used it and RecoNone group did not use the system at all during the time period. We provide a framework to analyze learning logs from EXAIT and extract emerging self-directed learning patterns. Analyzing 222 students' EXAIT logs, we found learners who had checked explanations while selecting recommendations had significantly higher performance. Further differential process mining highlighted significant active daily engagement transitions of the RecoExp group in the self-directed activity.
Academic Achievement in Mathematics of Higher-Middle Education Students in Veracruz: An Approach Based on Computational Intelligence;"Y. Céspedes-González; A. D. Otero Escobar; J. D. Ricárdez Jiménez; G. Molero-Castillo";2023;2023 11th International Conference in Software Engineering Research and Innovation (CONISOFT);Conference;IEEE;10.1109/CONISOFT58849.2023.00031;"Given the role that education plays in society; it is important to have a quality education system. In this sense, the academic achievement of students is an indicator that allows measuring the quality of education offered by educational systems. One way to measure academic achievement is through the results of standardized tests, as is the case of PLANEA in Mexico. This research paper presents the analysis of academic achievement in mathematics of high-middle education students in Veracruz, through an approach based on computational intelligence. For this, an unsupervised learning approach based on K-means was used, an algorithm that models a set of input variables and assigns elements (data vectors) with similar characteristics to certain clusters. The solution method was divided into four stages: data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, variable selection, and algorithm application. As a result, a differentiated segmentation was observed for the evaluation period. From this segmentation, some characteristics stand out in each group were identified, such as: the shift, degree of marginalization, support, programmed students and evaluated students."

The application of machine learning to automated group formation for collaborative work from learning system logs and other data has been progressing. Building on previous research in this field, we propose a group formation method that is based on a combination of course knowledge structures, reading behavior, and assessment analysis to create optimal heterogenous and homogeneous working groups using a genetic algorithm. The characteristics of each group are presented for explanation as a visualized knowledge map showing the strengths and weaknesses of each group, and are in the structure form of curriculum. We also present a case study of applying the method to junior high school mathematics log data, and provide explanation in a visualized form of standardized curriculum of group characteristics that are often referenced for learning design by teachers.
Combining Large Language Models with Tutoring System Intelligence: A Case Study in Caregiver Homework Support;"Venugopalan D.; Yan Z.; Borchers C.; Lin J.; Aleven V.";2025;15th  International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2025;Conference;Scopus;10.1145/3706468.3706516;Caregivers (i.e., parents and members of a child's caring community) are underappreciated stakeholders in learning analytics. Although caregiver involvement can enhance student academic outcomes, many obstacles hinder involvement, most notably knowledge gaps with respect to modern school curricula. An emerging topic of interest in learning analytics is hybrid tutoring, which includes instructional and motivational support. Caregivers assert similar roles in homework, yet it is unknown how learning analytics can support them. Our past work with caregivers suggested that conversational support is a promising method of providing caregivers with the guidance needed to effectively support student learning. We developed a system that provides instructional support to caregivers through conversational recommendations generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Addressing known instructional limitations of LLMs, we use instructional intelligence from tutoring systems while conducting prompt engineering experiments with the open-source Llama 3 LLM. This LLM generated message recommendations for caregivers supporting their child's math practice via chat. Few-shot prompting and combining real-time problem-solving context from tutoring systems with examples of tutoring practices yielded desirable message recommendations. These recommendations were evaluated with ten middle school caregivers, who valued recommendations facilitating content-level support and student metacognition through self-explanation. We contribute insights into how tutoring systems can best be merged with LLMs to support hybrid tutoring settings through conversational assistance, facilitating effective caregiver involvement in tutoring systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
Video Analysis Engine for Predicting Effectiveness;"Thareja R.; Dwivedi D.; Garg R.; Baghel S.; Shukla J.; Mohania M.";2025;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-78312-8_7;"In the realm of digital education, the growing use of short-form online videos, coupled with innovative generative AI methods, has dramatically expanded the production of didactic academic videos. This shift, however, underscores a critical question - how to ascertain the ""effectiveness"" of these videos for student learning? It is essential to devise a classification mechanism that filters videos for clarity, comprehensibility, and their capacity to meet student learning objectives. The automated evaluation of these learning videos holds substantial implications for student academic performance. Accordingly, this paper presents a novel supervised-learning-based approach, predicated on video feature analysis, to predict the effectiveness of K-12 science and mathematics videos. Our method integrates diverse features such as image, spoken text, and audio, among other hand-crafted elements, to accurately assess video effectiveness. We conduct an evaluation of our approach using a comprehensive dataset comprised of 3,134 short-form academic videos. The results demonstrate robust performance, with the system achieving an accuracy of 76.1% and an F1 score of 80.6%. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025."
Fair artificial intelligence to support STEM Education: A Hitchhiker's guide;"Xing W.; Li C.";2024;Uses of Artificial Intelligence in STEM Education;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1093/oso/9780198882077.003.0023;"Artificial intelligence (AI) incorporates the applications of machine-learning systems dominantly within the automated assessment and intelligent tutoring systems.

Exploring the Integration of Artificial Intelligence-Based ChatGPT into Mathematics Instruction: Perceptions, Challenges, and Implications for Educators;"Egara F.O.; Mosimege M.";2024;Education Sciences;Article;Scopus;10.3390/educsci14070742;This research investigates how secondary school mathematics educators in the Nsukka Education Zone, Enugu State, Nigeria, perceive the incorporation of artificial intelligence-based ChatGPT into teaching mathematics. The study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods strategy, starting with a systematic survey and followed by detailed interviews. The Mathematics Teachers’ Awareness and Perceptions of AI-based ChatGPT Questionnaire (MTAPACQ) used in this study was adapted from an existing online survey and administered to 80 mathematics teachers, who were selected using stratified random sampling to ensure varied representation across different local government areas. The survey explored teachers’ awareness, utilisation, and perceptions of ChatGPT. Following the quantitative phase, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of five teachers who were familiar with ChatGPT to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings indicate limited awareness of ChatGPT, with only 17% demonstrating familiarity with the technology. The infrequent utilisation of ChatGPT in mathematics teaching is mainly associated with this limited awareness. Teachers who integrate ChatGPT Report positive outcomes, including improved teaching effectiveness, heightened student engagement, and enhanced comprehension of complex concepts. Nevertheless, the overall perceptions of the tool’s impact on mathematics teaching and learning are moderate. The identified challenges in relation to integration include technical adaptability, curriculum alignment, and the need for customisation to accommodate diverse learning styles. This study emphasises the significance of continuous professional development and ongoing support for teachers to integrate AI-based ChatGPT into mathematics instruction proficiently. The insights derived from the findings hold value for educators, policymakers, and technology developers aspiring to elevate the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics education. © 2024 by the authors.
Using Specialized AI Services Offered by EOSC for the Professional Development of Science and Mathematics Teachers;"Kovalenko V.; Marienko M.";2025;Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-83520-9_21;The article addresses the issue of utilizing specialized AI services for science and mathematics subjects, considering the specifics of the educational materials. There are few free specialized AI services available. As an alternative, Ukrainian teachers of science and mathematics subjects often resort to using general AI services for the educational process, which may sometimes fit the aims of these subjects’ learning not enough. The EOSC environment (https://eosc-portal.eu/) encompasses specialized AI services primarily for scientists. These EOSC services are offered free of charge or as open-source platforms, with pre-registration required for on-demand access by developers. While the primary focus of EOSC AI services is on the scientific community, they can also be effectively used by teachers of secondary schools. It is to extend the benefits of AI in teaching science and mathematics. By adopting EOSC services, it becomes feasible to enhance students' understanding of specific materials and facilitate the study of complex terms and processes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.
Teaching the Specialized Language of Mathematics with a Data-Driven Approach: What Data Do We Use?;"Fissore C.; Floris F.; Conte M.M.; Sacchet M.";2025;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-73741-1_4;Numerous studies in Mathematics Education have shown that among the causes of disciplinary learning difficulties are the acquisition and understanding of its specialized language. Data-Driven Learning (DDL) is a didactic approach that treats language as data and sees students as researchers doing guided discovery activities. The exploration of corpora can effectively support reflection on the specialized languages of Mathematics. What data should be used? Students daily use the most recent Large Language Models (LLM) and Google, which can be used for linguistic investigations. However, it must be remembered that there is no total control over the data on which searches are carried out, the results, and the type of language they use. Control over the data is important, especially when teachers want to use these tools to design and deliver didactic activities. This paper presents a recent DDL research activity with 80 secondary school students on the specialized language of Mathematics. The students conducted linguistic investigations on a specially designed corpus and carried out corpus-based activities with automatic formative assessment within a Digital Learning Environment. The results show that the students appreciated the proposed activities. They develop linguistic and mathematical skills and become more aware of the importance of the language they use. Students developed digital skills in browsing, searching, and filtering data, as well as in evaluating data, information, and digital content. LLM, such as ChatGPT, could not be used for the same type of activity, but with appropriate design, they can be used as a starting point for investigation and linguistic reflection. In the future, given the notable diffusion of these AI tools, it is essential to train teachers and students on their strengths and weaknesses and how they influence teaching and learning. © The Author(s) 2025.
Bridging the Gender Gap: The Role of AI-Powered Math Story Creation in Learning Outcomes;"Zhu W.; Xing W.; Lyu B.; Li C.; Zhang F.; Li H.";2025;15th  International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2025;Conference;Scopus;10.1145/3706468.3706539;Addressing the gender gap in K-12 math education is essential for providing equitable learning opportunities, as historical disparities in engagement, performance, and confidence between male and female students in mathematics are often linked to educational biases. Integrating Generative AI (GAI) into math education shows promise for bridging the gender gap in K12 math learning. This study proposes an innovative pedagogy and platform that enables students to create math stories powered by GAI, enhancing their conceptual understanding of key mathematical ideas. The platform was implemented in two K5 schools to evaluate its effectiveness and mechanism (N = 86). Pre- and post-intervention surveys and usage logs indicated significant improvements in students' learning outcomes regarding Math Question (MQ) skills and Math Story (MS) skills. Bayes SEM further modeled the mechanism: students' creating math stories powered by GAI significantly improves MS, which further improves MQ. We further found female students were significantly more engaged in creating stories on this platform and gained more improvement on MQ than male students. The results suggest that AI-powered math story creation can be an effective tool for deepening students' mathematical learning outcomes and has the potential to mitigate the gender gap. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
Widening the Digital Divide: The mediating role of Intelligent Tutoring Systems in the relationship between rurality, socioeducational advantage, and mathematics learning outcomes;"Hannan B.; Eynon R.";2025;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2025.105312;This study examines how the effects of school socioeducational advantage and rurality upon mathematics learning outcomes, are impacted by students’ usage of the ITS platform AdaptiveMath. Activity log data from the AdaptiveMath platform was merged with school sociodemographic data from the public MySchool database. The final analytic sample comprised of 66,451 Australian high school students across 304 schools in Years 7–10, who used the AdaptiveMath ITS platform in 2023. Structural Equation Modelling was employed to examine both the direct and indirect effects of school socioeducational advantage and rurality on student usage of the AdaptiveMath platform, and the resulting student learning outcomes. This study finds marginal, but statistically significant relationships between ITS usage and learning outcomes, and the socioeducational advantage and rurality of a student's school. Students who are from more affluent and urban schools use the ITS platform earlier in their school career, for more years, and have higher learning outcomes than their rural, less affluent peers. Further, ITS usage was found to mediate the relationship between socioeducational advantage and rurality, such that it amplified the positive effects of socioeducational advantage, and the negative effects of rurality, upon learning outcomes. The results suggest that introducing ITS platforms into Australian mathematics teaching will not reduce achievement gaps between affluent and disadvantaged schools. Rather, a Matthew Effect may be observed, whereby students attending privileged schools use ITS platforms more effectively, thereby contributing to an even greater disparities in learning outcome. © 2025 The Authors
RICE AlgebraBot: Lessons learned from designing and developing responsible conversational AI using induction, concretization, and exemplification to support algebra learning;"Li C.; Xing W.; Song Y.; Lyu B.";2025;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.caeai.2024.100338;The importance and challenge of Algebra learning is widely recognized, with students across the U.S. facing difficulties due to the subject's complexity. While extensive research has focused on enhancing Algebra learning in K-12 education, the reusability, scalability, and effectiveness of the strategies employed (e.g., manual interventions and digital tutoring platforms) remain limited. Conversational AI (ConvAI), enabled by the advancement of large language models (LLMs), emerges as a potential tool for automatic, personalized, and effective student support. However, ethical concerns surrounding diversity, safety, sentiment, and stereotype associated with ConvAI are prominent, and empirical studies examining its application in education are scarce. The purpose of this study is to develop a ConvAI system that mitigates the potential ethical concerns and empirically evaluate the effect of such a system for math learning. Specifically, we first examined computational strategies to mitigate the ethical concerns of ConvAI in educational setting with educational big data (npretraining = 2,097,139) and found that researchers could effectively enhance ConvAI responsibility through the investigated algorithmic strategies. Then, a ConvAI system was constructed using these strategies, guided by learning sciences principles. Lastly, we examined students' eye-tracking patterns, acceptance, and learning processes when using this ConvAI system to learn Algebra through a random experiment (nparticipant = 151). Participants using the developed ConvAI demonstrated generally increased visual attention levels as compared to the control group. Moreover, participants expressed a positive acceptance towards the ConvAI technology. Finally, participants' interaction patterns with the ConvAI technology influenced their Algebra learning. These results provide insights for both educational researchers and practitioners to integrate ConvAI in learning environments. © 2024 The Authors

"Analysis and comparison of generative AI and mathematics teachers’ answers to an euclidean geometric problem; [Análisis y comparación de respuestas aportadas por IA generativa y por profesores de matemática a un problema de geometría euclidiana]";"Corica A.R.; Parra V.; Sureda P.; Schiaffino S.; Godoy D.";2025;Educacion Matematica;Article;Scopus;10.24844/EM3701.05;This work aims to shed some light on the performance of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in solving mathematical problems and its impact on the teaching profession. The conceptual framework adopted throughout this work is Problem Based Learning. The answers to a problem offered by GAI models and mathematics teachers are explored, analyzed and compared. The problem studied belongs to euclidean geometry, and it is characterized by not admitting a single and immediate answer. It consists of dividing a circle into three surfaces of any dimension but with equal area. The categories for analysis are type of cut, representation system, level of mathematical validation and resolution type. We concluded that GAI offers inconsistent responses, little variety of answers, with few mathematical validations and with a predominance of a colloquial representation system. The teachers’ answers are correct, they offer a great variety of partitions, the predominant representation systems are geometric, graphic and arithmetic ones, and they offer some type of validation. It is concluded that the use of GAI models are not appropriate for this type of problems, without any critical reasoning. © 2025 Mexican Society for Research and Dissemination of Mathematics Education.

Board 211: Building a'Project-Based Learning for Rural Alabama STEM Middle School Teachers in Machine Learning and Robotics' RET Site (Year 2);"Gong X.; Marghitu D.";2024;ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--46779;"This paper is based on a longitudinal project funded by the National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science grant. The primary objective of this project is to develop an RET Site under CISE at Auburn University (AU) in Alabama. The title of the research project is ""RET Site: Project-Based Learning for Rural Alabama STEM Middle School Teachers in Machine Learning and Robotics"", and this project provides engaging research experiences to middle and high school science teachers from primarily rural and underserved school districts in Alabama. In-service teachers (7th and 8th grade) participate in a 6-week summer professional development program with an emphasis on machine learning and AI. In addition, to the summer professional development institute teachers lead a weeklong summer camp for middle school students where they have an opportunity to implement curriculum modules they have developed and the project team provides support for teachers to implement the curriculum modules during the academic year as well. Providing consistent support and professional development for teachers in underserved school districts is essential for preparing students with the 21st century skills they will need to engage in an increasingly technological society. This is also essential for broadening participation in STEM for students from traditionally underrepresented populations. Engaging teachers' innovative content (e.g. AI, machine learning, robotics) enhances their pedagogical content knowledge and provides them the skills to better prepare their students to become scientists, engineers, innovators, and entrepreneurs in these areas. As part of this RET project, teachers explore various research topics alongside faculty mentors' and learn how to connect their science and mathematics objectives to machine learning, mobile robot, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality concepts and develop curriculum modules using this content. Teachers also engage with science education researchers to better understand how to make the science content more relevant to their students' daily lives. Teachers enhanced their knowledge in inquiry-based, hands-on research pedagogical strategies and structured and designed their lessons through a lens of project-based learning. Key to this project was demonstrating how leveraging an innovative platform of ML-based mobile robots can be friendly and easily accessible to teachers. This project also fosters strong collaborations between in-service teachers, and engineering and STEM education faculty. Program participants for yr2 included seven teachers, one male and six females. Of the seven teacher participants four identified as African American, two identified as white, and one participant identified as biracial. Surveys instruments included the Project Knowledge Scale, the Patterns of Adaptive Learning Scales (PALS), Computer Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale all used to measure teachers' knowledge, attitudes, computer, and teaching self-efficacy changes pre and post surveys were disseminated to program participates during the summer 6-week professional development institute. Research findings indicated that teacher participant knowledge, attitudes, computer self-efficacy, and teaching self-efficacy increased slightly after the summer professional development institute. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2024."
Automated feedback improves teachers’ questioning quality in brick-and-mortar classrooms: Opportunities for further enhancement;"Demszky D.; Liu J.; Hill H.C.; Sanghi S.; Chung A.";2025;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2024.105183;AI-powered professional learning tools that provide teachers with individualized feedback on their instruction have proven effective at improving instruction and student engagement in virtual learning contexts. Despite the need for consistent, personalized professional learning in K-12 settings, the effectiveness of automated feedback tools in traditional classrooms remains unexplored. We present results from 224 Utah mathematics and science teachers who engaged in a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, conducted in partnership with TeachFX, to assess the impact of automated feedback in K-12 classrooms. This feedback targeted “focusing questions” — questions that probe students’ thinking by pressing for explanations and reflection. We find that teachers opened emails containing the automated feedback about 53–65% of the time, and the feedback increased their use of focusing questions by 20% (p < 0.01) compared to the control group. The feedback did not impact other teaching practices. Qualitative interviews with 13 teachers revealed mixed perceptions of the automated feedback. Some teachers appreciated the reflective insights, while others faced barriers such as skepticism about accuracy, data privacy concerns, and time constraints. Our findings highlight the promises and areas of improvement for implementing effective and teacher-friendly automated professional learning tools in brick-and-mortar classrooms. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd
AI-Driven Educational Transformation in Secondary Schools: Leveraging Data Insights for Inclusive Learning Environments;"Duraes D.; Bezerra R.; Novais P.";2024;IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578910;In recent years, in the field of education, there has been a progressive trend towards teaching that is more personalised to students' characteristics and some models of prediction failure that are more accurate. In this sense, machine learning techniques have contributed to this realisation. This transformation has been significantly influenced by the integration of machine learning techniques, which have played a crucial role in harnessing data to enhance educational practices. This paper investigates the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, focusing on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within secondary education, with a specific focus on the utilization of student assessment data and socioeconomic contextual information. So, this paper explores the application of AI algorithms to create tailored learning pathways, adaptive support mechanisms, and targeted interventions that accommodate diverse student backgrounds. The integration of AI in secondary education is envisioned not only as a means to enhance academic outcomes but also as a tool to promote social equity and inclusivity. By leveraging data insights, educators can identify and respond to the unique needs of each student, fostering an environment where learning is optimized for individual growth. Furthermore, the paper scrutinizes the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying AI systems in educational settings, emphasizing the pivotal role of equity, transparency, and data privacy in these implementations. This research aims to offer educators, policymakers, and stakeholder's insights into harnessing AI to foster adaptable, student-centric learning environments that bridge educational gaps and promote holistic academic development in secondary schools. Ethical guidelines and frameworks are discussed to ensure responsible AI deployment in educational contexts, safeguarding the rights and privacy of students. The data explored is taken from the management system of a secondary school in the municipality of Braga, relating to students taking Maths A, Maths B or Maths Applied to the Social Sciences (MACS). A total of 621 students were analysed, of which: 520 students attended Mathematics A in the Science and Technology and Socio-Economic Sciences courses, 20 attended Mathematics B in the Visual Arts course and 81 attended Mathematics Applied to Social Sciences in the Languages and Humanities course. The different maths subjects were analysed separately and at the end a comparative study was carried out between the three strands. Grounded in the analysis of these integrated datasets, the study sheds light on the pivotal role of AI in revolutionizing secondary school education. By closely examining student assessment data alongside socioeconomic indicators, such as academic performance and behavioral patterns, the paper identifies opportunities for AI integration to personalize learning experiences, address educational disparities, and cultivate inclusive learning environments. In Maths A there are 268 female and 252 male students. In Maths B there are 18 females and 2 males (most of the arts subjects are taken by women). In MACS the distribution is as follows: 45 female and 36 male. All these students, regardless of the area they chose at the start of secondary school, have in common the choice of Maths, however Maths A will be taken throughout secondary school, while the other two strands are only taken in the first two years of secondary school. Data fusuion techniques have achieved better performance in this type of study, since the models themselves combine the predictions of two or more base models.  © 2024 IEEE.

Can Generative AI Solve Geometry Problems? Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs for Geometric Reasoning in Spanish;"Parra V.; Sureda P.; Corica A.; Schiaffino S.; Godoy D.";2024;International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence;Article;Scopus;10.9781/ijimai.2024.02.009;Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive technology that is challenging traditional teaching and learning practices. Question-answering in natural language fosters the use of chatbots, such as ChatGPT, Bard and others, that generate text based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). The performance of these models in certain areas, like Math problem solving is receiving a crescent attention as it directly impacts on its potential use in educational settings. Most of these evaluations, however, concentrate on the construction and use of benchmarks comprising diverse Math problems in English. In this work, we discuss the capabilities of most used LLMs within the subfield of Geometry, in view of the relevance of this subject in high-school curricula and the difficulties exhibited by even most advanced multimodal LLMs to deal with geometric notions. This work focuses on Spanish, which is additionally a less resourced language. The answers of three major chatbots, based on different LLMs, were analyzed not only to determine their capacity to provide correct solutions, but also to categorize the errors found in the reasoning processes described. Understanding LLMs strengths and weaknesses in a field like Geometry can be a first step towards the design of more informed methodological proposals to include these technologies in classrooms as well as the development of more powerful automatic assistance tools based on generative AI. © 2024, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Aligning AIED Systems to Embodied Cognition and Learning Theories;"Arroyo I.; Rasul I.; Crabtree D.; Castro F.; Poh A.; Gattupalli S.; Lee W.; Smith H.; Micciolo M.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-64315-6_1;"Embodied Learning involves the development of perceptuo-motor schemas as students manipulate physical objects that embody a concept, or when students move in domain-relevant ways, physically enacting solutions to problems, as well as gesturing as they interact with peers face-to-face. Teaching standards (e.g., for K-12 math education) align with such theories of learning. For instance, teachers are encouraged to have students “talk mathematics”, construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, model with mathematics, and use tools with precision, among others. Yet most learning technologies and tutoring systems are not designed to facilitate embodied learning; instead, they tend to align with more traditional views of student learning. This paper explores possible ways AIED systems can reflect embodied learning theories, within K-12 STEM education. We present the WearableLearning platform as an example that intends to bring embodied learning to mathematics and computing education for students at the K-12 level, with implications and suggestions on how to use Artificial Intelligence to make embodied learning environments more effective. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024."

Learning Factors for TIMSS Math Performance Evidenced Through Machine Learning in the UAE;"Nadaf A.; Monroe S.; Chandran S.; Miao X.";2023;Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1007/978-981-19-8040-4_4;Understanding how the UAE K12 education system performs with data-driven evidence is key to inform better policy making to support UAE vision to upskill human capital growth for its economic transformation. In this study, we investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques to understand key learning factors contributing to UAE student math performance on the TIMSS 2019 assessment. Due to the fact that learning factors co-exist and interact with one another, we explore the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the complexity of the model. The results highlight the importance and contributions of each learning factor and uncover the relationships between the learning factors. Understanding key learning factors and identifying evidence-based intervention opportunities will help policymakers with informed education intervention designs to improve student mathematics learning, in order to improve UAE student TIMSS math performance over the long run. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.
Artificial Intelligence in Secondary Education: An Innovative Teacher’s Tool to Ensure Individualised Learning for Students;"Lytvynova S.; Vodopian N.; Sysoeva O.";2024;Communications in Computer and Information Science;Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-63235-8_26;In recent years, the digital transformation of society has characterised access to the Internet as a prerequisite for educational activities. Artificial intelligence (AI) has opened up new opportunities for developing individualised learning for students. A 2023 study analyses the results of using artificial intelligence by teachers of Ukrainian secondary schools. The main goal of the survey is to determine the state of AI applications for individualised learning and the integration of this technology into pedagogical practice. The study examines the timing of digital technology implementation and its impact on the continuous development of teachers’ digital competencies. Particular attention is paid to the aspects of AI implementation, including educational purposes, teacher readiness, and limitations of this technology. It is established that to implement individualised learning, the goal and objectives of individualisation, the choice of AI services and platforms, opportunities for students, security measures, learning pace, level of mastery of the material and personal interests should be considered. The author proposes a classification of tasks for students using AI and provides examples of assessments for students of grades 7–9 in English, mathematics, and biology. Emphasis is given to the fact that AI-powered automatic assessment enables the recognition of the requirements of every individual student and adapts learning tasks according to their current abilities and knowledge. Despite the challenges and problems of integrating AI into the school environment, the study points to the growing interest of teachers in this technology, the improvement of AI capabilities, and its gradual development as a teacher’s assistant. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
Evaluating Productivity of Learning Habits Using Math Learning Logs: Do K12 Learners Manage Their Time Effectively?;"Hsu C.-Y.; Horikoshi I.; Li H.; Majumdar R.; Ogata H.";2024;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_12;Habits refer to behaviors that occur repetitively. As ICT tools spread widely in learners’ school lives, the Learning Analytics (LA) techniques enable researchers to monitor learners’ daily activities and understand their habitual behaviors via fine-grained analysis of the log data that traces one’s actions in digital environments. While types of learning habits were commonly evaluated with academic performance, little evaluation focused on whether the existing habit types involve high learning productivity. Therefore, this study evaluates the productivity of habit types using effective time management factors, including effectiveness, efficiency, and effortlessness. We collected learning logs from 114 learners at the age of 15 on average in a Japanese junior high school. Specifically, we analyzed their self-directed learning of doing math exercises from Apr. 2022 to Feb. 2023. The findings strengthen the importance of teaching and learning process through a better time management strategy in terms of building learning habits, where many students face difficulties. As the implications of this study, we could support learners in time awareness and time adjusting by recommending an appropriate type of learning habits considering its productivity. Hence, the regular scheduling of learning activities can not only improve the learning productivity of learners but also cultivate skills of self-directed learning with effective time management. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.
AI-based Learning Assistants: Enhancing Math Learning for Migrant Students in German Schools;"Kretzschmar V.; Seitz J.";2024;Proceedings - 2024 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence, CAI 2024;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/CAI59869.2024.00035;"Increasing migration leads the education landscape to face the challenge of integrating children into the school system, accounting for inherent disadvantages. On average, as nearly half of them face socio-economic disadvantages, a persistent performance disparity was observed compared to domestic students. Remarkably, even after mitigating the influence of socioeconomic status, immigrant students' scores remained inferior. From March to May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project investigated how an AI-based learning assistant can compensate for existing impediments by enabling a better understanding through video-based learning. For this study, 275 students were selected from two secondary schools (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The experiment tested the extent to which learners solve more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and retain it. Students were repeatedly tested on mathematical problems, where the control group did not have access to the AI assistant. In contrast, the other group used the AI assistant to solve the problems. The students' performances from both school groups were statistically tested using t-tests. Within the test group of grammar schools, a significant change in the results between the two test days existed (T(41)=-2,28; pc.01) when the AI tool was used. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change T(37)=-.42; p>.05; d=.O7) in performance. However, the results were insignificant for the secondary school students, as the given tasks and video content were considered too demanding. Further research is needed to determine AIEDN's performance for other target groups. © 2024 IEEE."
Research on Knowledge Graph Extraction Methods for Chinese STEM Curriculum;"Wang C.; Sang X.; Wang X.; Gao Y.; Liu Y.";2024;MLNLP 2024 - 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/MLNLP63328.2024.10800180;STEM education, as an innovative teaching model, has gained widespread attention in recent years. However, the lack of relevant textBooks and learning resources has made its implementation challenging. Developing interdisciplinary knowledge graphs tailored for STEM education has become an urgent issue. To address this, a knowledge extraction framework named Llms4edu is proposed, which utilizes a series of effective prompts to guide large language models in knowledge extraction. Specifically, the knowledge extraction task is transformed into multiple rounds of question-and-answer interactions with the LLM, gradually identifying entity-relation triplets from subject data. Through experiments, an F1-score of 89.4% was achieved on the named entity recognition task in the chemistry subject, and an F1-score of 66.7% on the relation extraction task. Finally, a subject ontology model was built for subject text, and a subject data set was constructed using Llms4edu, which includes three subjects of junior high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry, a total of 2,511 entities, 2,010 relationship triples, and cross-disciplinary knowledge is linked to construct a cross-disciplinary knowledge graph. © 2024 IEEE.
Assessing the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tutoring system for improving college-level mathematics preparedness in high school students;"Nehring J.; Moyer-Packenham P.; North M.";2023;Issues in Information Systems;Article;Scopus;10.48009/1_iis_2023_111;Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been used to help high school students transition from the mathematics taught in high school to the mathematics expected at colleges and universities. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between high school students’ performance in Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) Placement, Preparation, and Learning (PPL) Modules and performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. The participants in this study were 100 students from five high schools in the United States. Each student was placed into one of two groups: the ALEKS Group, who completed the ALEKS Pre-Calculus Learning Modules, and the Non-ALEKS Group, who did not complete the modules. Students’ scores were compared statistically to test for significant differences. The analysis included a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to measure how assignment of the modules affected exam scores. A logistic regression was used to assess differences between the two groups in placing into college algebra. A statistically significant difference was found in exam scores between the ALEKS Group and the Non-ALEKS Group which indicated that assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Learning Modules did increase performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. Conversely, assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Modules did not increase students’ likelihood of placing into College Algebra. The amount of time students spent taking the exam influenced student outcomes on the ALEKS Mathematics Placement exam. These results show that schools could implement Intelligent Tutoring Systems into their current mathematics classrooms to help students increase their scores on college entry mathematics placement exams. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.
Novel Feature-Based Difficulty Prediction Method for Mathematics Items Using XGBoost-Based SHAP Model;"Yi X.; Sun J.; Wu X.";2024;Mathematics;Article;Scopus;10.3390/math12101455;The level of difficulty of mathematical test items is a critical aspect for evaluating test quality and educational outcomes. Accurately predicting item difficulty during test creation is thus significantly important for producing effective test papers. This study used more than ten years of content and score data from China’s Henan Provincial College Entrance Examination in Mathematics as an evaluation criterion for test difficulty, and all data were obtained from the Henan Provincial Department of Education. Based on the framework established by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for test item assessment methodology, this paper proposes a new framework containing eight features considering the uniqueness of mathematics. Next, this paper proposes an XGBoost-based SHAP model for analyzing the difficulty of mathematics tests. By coupling the XGBoost method with the SHAP method, the model not only evaluates the difficulty of mathematics tests but also analyzes the contribution of specific features to item difficulty, thereby increasing transparency and mitigating the “black box” nature of machine learning models. The model has a high prediction accuracy of 0.99 for the training set and 0.806 for the test set. With the model, we found that parameter-level features and reasoning-level features are significant factors influencing the difficulty of subjective items in the exam. In addition, we divided senior secondary mathematics knowledge into nine units based on Chinese curriculum standards and found significant differences in the distribution of the eight features across these different knowledge units, which can help teachers place different emphasis on different units during the teaching process. In summary, our proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of item difficulty prediction, which is crucial for intelligent educational applications such as knowledge tracking, automatic test item generation, and intelligent paper generation. These results provide tools that are better aligned with and responsive to students’ learning needs, thus effectively informing educational practice. © 2024 by the authors.

Feedback in Online Mathematics Tutoring;"Jan?a?ík A.; Michal J.; Novotná J.";2023;International Conference on Computer Supported Education, CSEDU - Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;10.5220/0012017500003470;The goal of this paper is to present issues related to assessment and feedback in the framework of online mathematics tutoring implemented with the help of a chatbot using Artificial intelligence (AI) (Jan?a?ík et al., 2022). The presented project aims to create a teaching course that is intended to help the pupil in independent preparation for the national entrance exams in mathematics for upper secondary schools in the Czech Republic. The course takes the form of a chatbot with which a pupil can communicate in a web browser environment or the Telegram communication application designed for all common operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, ...). The chatbot also includes a communication module using artificial intelligence that can communicate with the pupil beyond the scope of the designed course. The following two questions are addressed in the part of the research that is presented in this paper. The first question is what form of feedback is effective in the given environment and most reflect the nature of tutoring. The second question is how the chosen procedures must be modified for the different areas of mathematics the course focuses on. The paper presents an implementation within the area of algebra and geometry. Copyright © 2023 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.
Vik's Adventures: Enhancing Mathematical Learning in Secondary School Students Through a Serious Game Integrated with a Deep Learning Model;"Lussine C.P.S.; Yaquelin M.A.L.; Elio N.V.";2024;Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE 4th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies for Education and Research, ICALTER 2024;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/ICALTER65499.2024.10819208;The integration of deep learning and serious games within educational frameworks offers innovative pathways to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. This research presents a serious game in a web application designed to improve mathematical skills among first-year secondary school students in Peru. The project employs advanced deep learning techniques to personalize learning paths based on individual performance metrics. Using a dataset of diagnostic responses, our model achieved 84.1 per cent accuracy after 50 training epochs, indicating significant potential for personalized education.

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Teacher Practices in Supporting Student Learning and Engagement in an AI-Enabled Classroom;"Karumbaiah S.; Borchers C.; Shou T.; Falhs A.-C.; Liu P.; Nagashima T.; Rummel N.; Aleven V.";2023;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_37;Research indicates that teachers play an active and important role in classrooms with AI tutors. Yet, our scientific understanding of the way teacher practices around AI tutors mediate student learning is far from complete. In this paper, we investigate spatiotemporal factors of student-teacher interactions by analyzing student engagement and learning with an AI tutor ahead of teacher visits (defined as episodes of a teacher being in close physical proximity to a student) and immediately following teacher visits. To conduct such integrated, temporal analysis around the moments when teachers visit students, we collect fine-grained, time-synchronized data on teacher positions in the physical classroom and student interactions with the AI tutor. Our case study in a K12 math classroom with a veteran math teacher provides some indications on factors that might affect a teacher’s decision to allocate their limited classroom time to their students and what effects these interactions have on students. For instance, teacher visits were associated more with students’ in-the-moment behavioral indicators (e.g., idleness) than a broader, static measure of student needs such as low prior knowledge. While teacher visits were often associated with positive changes in student behavior afterward (e.g., decreased idleness), there could be a potential mismatch between students visited by the teacher and who may have needed it more at that time (e.g., students who were disengaged for much longer). Overall, our findings indicate that teacher visits may yield immediate benefits for students but also that it is challenging for teachers to meet all needs – suggesting the need for better tool support. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
Enhancing the Admissions Process for Engineering Baccalaureate Programs: A Machine Learning Approach to Developing a Valid and Reliable Examination;"Ramos M.S.; Barajas J.R.B.; Gealone P.J.N.; Aspra N.O.; Padua O.M.; Lucero A.T.";2023;2023 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium, SIEDS 2023;Conference;Scopus;10.1109/SIEDS58326.2023.10137793;This paper details an approach to identify multiple-choice questions that are most effective in discriminating deficiencies in mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students who are graduates of the K-12 program that was recently implemented in the Philippines. To achieve this objective, machine learning algorithms such as the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) were implemented. From a question bank containing 1,300 questions covering Algebra (A), Advanced Algebra (AA), Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (T), Analytic Geometry (AG), and Solid Mensuration (SM), five domain experts identified the suitability of the questions as part of a diagnostic examination in mathematics. Specifically, using a 5-point Likert scale (5 being the highest), the experts rated the suitability of each question to test the proficiency of a student in 23 mathematics competencies based on what is prescribed by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The collected survey data were then used to train the machine learning models, which extracted patterns to identify the questions that would be most suitable to test the mathematics competencies of incoming first-year engineering students. With a precision recall score of 99.90%, the LR model was selected as the best performing model and analysis of how the LR model predicts the labels through the use of shap values revealed that the preference was given towards questions which test student proficiency in foundational mathematics competencies like that of Algebra and Analytical Geometry. Overall, these findings provided a better understanding of the questions that are most effective in discriminating student deficiencies in mathematics subjects.  © 2023 IEEE.

Finally, the framework was applied to a case study in the context of the Ecuadorian General Basic Education curriculum for the subject of Mathematics, using three phases, three components, and two sublevels. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
A multimodal platform to teach mathematics to students with vision-impairment;"Jariwala A.; Marghitu D.; Chapman R.";2021;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-030-78095-1_10;The advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the last decade have led many developers, universities, and researchers to invest in the research and development of digital teaching platforms. This paper compares existing features implemented in the first prototype and provides visually impaired high-school students with a system to learn and practice mathematical problems. This project describes possibilities provided by open-source APIs such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and shows how to implement them to make education universal and accessible. We aim to achieve this by introducing an open-source platform, which will provide a set of modules for personalized speech recognition and accessible online tutoring. The system is divided into two modules: First, an intelligent conversational agent to help students learn new mathematical concepts, which opens up possibilities of providing students with a personalized response. Second, a mathematical expression parser and evaluator to help the student practice mathematical questions.

Modeling Engagement in Self-Directed Learning Systems Using Principal Component Analysis;"Hershcovits H.; Vilenchik D.; Gal K.";2020;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;Article;Scopus;10.1109/TLT.2019.2922902;This paper studies students engagement in e-learning environments in which students work independently and solve problems without external supervision. We propose a new method to infer engagement patterns of users in such self-directed environments. We view engagement as a continuous process in time, measured along chosen axes that are derived from student data in the system using unsupervised learning (Principal Component Analysis). We construct a trajectory of user activity by projecting the user's scores along the selected PCs at regular time intervals. This approach is applied to a popular e-learning software for K12 math education that is used by thousands of students worldwide. We identify cohorts of users according to the way their trajectory changes over time (e.g., monotone up, monotone down, and constant). Each of the cohorts exhibits distinct behavioral dynamics and differed substantially in the amount of time users spent in the e-learning system. Specifically, one cohort included students that dropped out of the system after choosing very difficult problems that they were not able to complete, while another cohort included students users that chose more diverse problems and stayed longer in the system. In future work, these results can be used by teachers or intelligent tutors to track students' engagement in the system and decide whether and how to intervene. © 2008-2011 IEEE.
A systematic review of the literature regarding socially assistive robots in pre-tertiary education;"Papadopoulos I.; Lazzarino R.; Miah S.; Weaver T.; Thomas B.; Koulouglioti C.";2020;Computers and Education;Article;Scopus;10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103924;With rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last decade, schools have increasingly employed innovative tools, intelligent applications and methods that are changing the education system with the aim of improving both user experience and learning gain in the classrooms. Even though the use of AI to education is not new, it has not unleashed its full potential yet. Much of the available research looks at educational robotics and at non-intelligent robots in education. Only recently, research has sought to assess the potential of Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), including humanoids, within the domain of classroom learning, particularly in relation to learning languages. Yet, the use of this form of AI in the field of mathematics and science constitutes a notable gap in this field. This study aims to critically review the research on the use of SARs in the pre-tertiary classroom teaching of mathematics and science. Further aim is to identify the benefits and disadvantages of such technology. Databases' search conducted between January and April 2018 yielded twenty-one studies meeting the set inclusion criteria for our systematic review. Findings were grouped into four major categories synThesising current evidence of the contribution of SARs in pre-tertiary education: learning gain, user experience, attitude, and usability of SARs within classroom settings. Overall, the use of SARs in pre-tertiary education is promising, but studies focussing on mathematics and science are significantly under-represented. Further evidence is also required around SARs' specific contributions to learning more broadly, as well as enabling/impeding factors, such as SAR's personalisation and appearance, or the role of families and ethical considerations. Finally, SARs potential to enhance accessibility and inclusivity of multi-cultural pre-tertiary classroom is almost unexplored. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd
Automated Matching of Exercises with Knowledge components;"Tian Z.; Flanagan B.; Dai Y.; Ogata H.";2022;30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;;As intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) fast develop, they have been implemented in many classrooms combing with various tutorial tools. Especially, matching exercises with knowledge components is the fundamental task of many applications, such as automatic recommendation, student knowledge tracing etc. However, manually labelling educational data is labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, a range of machine learning methods has been proposed to address this problem, while few of them focusing on Japanese educational dataset in the real high school. In this paper, we leverage natural language processing techniques with Keyphrase extraction methods based on Japanese math exercises.

Intelligent system for interactive teaching through videogames;"Robles D.; Quintero M. C.G.";2020;Sustainability (Switzerland);Article;Scopus;10.3390/SU12093573;Education, videogames, and intelligent systems are all relevant topics for researchers. Determining means of improving academic performance using a range of techniques and tools is an important challenge. However, while there are currently websites and multimedia resources that help students to improve their knowledge on specific topics, these lack in not having intelligent agents that can evaluate students and recommend materials to suit the difficulty that a user is having in a given subject. In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students' skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered. The results indicate that the implementation jointly of videogames and intelligent systems allows users to improve their performance in the given topics. © 2020 by the authors.

We introduce a mobile-friendly, digital support for analog learning experiences called LiveHint, which currently supports students as they work on assignments in Carnegie Learning’s physical worktexts via a chatbot with access to thousands of context-sensitive hints. In addition to expanding the number of courses supported by LiveHint, we discuss possibilities for expanding the scope of activities supported by LiveHint within Carnegie Learning’s existing content. We also lay out possibilities for expanding the approach beyond Carnegie Learning’s content to teacher-created artifacts (e.g., custom worksheets), hand-offs between instructional modalities, and potential research use-cases for data collected from such a platform.

Student Low Achievement Prediction;"Zanellati A.; Zingaro S.P.; Gabbrielli M.";2022;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);Conference;Scopus;10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5_76;In this paper, we propose a method for assessing the risk of low achievement in primary and secondary school. We train three machine learning models with data collected by the Italian Ministry of Education through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests. We compare the results of the trained models and evaluate the effectiveness of the solutions in terms of performance and interpretability. We test our methods on data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.
Development and Application of an Intelligent Assessment System for Mathematics Learning Strategy among High School Students—Take Jianzha County as an Example;"Wang G.; Chen X.; Zhang D.; Kang Y.; Wang F.; Su M.";2022;Sustainability (Switzerland);Article;Scopus;10.3390/su141912265;"To improve the quality of mathematics learning for high school students in economically disadvantaged areas, and promote education equity and sustainable development, this study developed the Mathematics Learning Strategies Intelligent Assessment and Strategy Implementation System by using artificial intelligence technology. The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants’ diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system’s effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students’ mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective. © 2022 by the authors."
Construction of teacher-student interaction evaluation index system for high school mathematics concept assimilation learning based on artificial intelligence;"Zhen Y.; Shi S.; Wang W.; Wang G.";2022;Artificial Intelligence in Education and Teaching Assessment;Book chapter;Scopus;10.1007/978-981-16-6502-8_13;Teacher-student interaction is one of the most critical teaching behaviors in high school mathematics classrooms. As one of the main parts of mathematics teaching, concepts are the core of mathematics knowledge. Moreover, concept assimilation is the essential learning approach for senior students to acquire mathematics concepts. Therefore, this study constructed the Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning. Combining both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, this study first constructed the evaluation system from the theoretical perspective using the Delphi method. Then, the video analysis was used to verify the evaluation system by conducting a qualitative analysis of high-quality teaching videos from the practical perspective with the help of artificial intelligence. Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning constructed in this study included four first-level indicators: teacher-student interaction in the concept recognition stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept processing stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept reinforcement stage, and teacher-student interaction in the concept application stage, and eight second-level indicators: mutual communication, mobilizing learning initiative, explanation and exploration, inspired focus, example analysis, inspiration and concentration, task solving, and encouragement and feedback. This study could provide quantitative evaluation tools and theoretical models for teacher-student interaction in concept assimilation learning, and enrich teachers' understanding of concept teaching theory and teacher-student interaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.
Digital Device and Mathematics: Multilevel vs Machine Learning Models for Value-added Ranking in Italy;Papa D.;2022;International Conference on Computer Supported Education, CSEDU - Proceedings;Conference;Scopus;10.5220/0011042700003182;With the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of distance education programs, digital learning is popular and strategic in many learning fields. The deployment of Information and Communications Technology and its impact on both national and international learning programs are becoming increasingly significant. This study seeks to explore in the Italian context both the effectiveness of digital learning in Mathematics Education and which features and how affect value-added at the classroom level. To explore Information and Communications Technology contribution and value-added scoring, the study takes into consideration the analytical power of classical multilevel models concerning the predictive power of different types of machine learning models. The study aims to investigate how Information and Communications Technology, and related concepts, impact the Weighted Likelihood Estimates in Mathematics for students in the lower secondary school, using data from the INVALSI of the school year 2017/2018. The main finding is that Personal Computer ownership at home plays an important role in mathematical learning. Finally, a machine learning model incorporated in the educational domain can be an interesting starting point for developing class-predictive policies.

They provided insights about learning opportunities in the activity and feedback for integrating it into their teaching. Findings from qualitative analysis demonstrate that exploring text classification models provided an accessible and comprehensive approach for integrated learning of mathematics, language arts, and computing with the potential of supporting the understanding of core AI concepts including identifying structure within unstructured data and reasoning about the roles of human insight in developing AI technologies. © ISLS.
The Dynamic Vectors-Based Attention Model for Chinese Mathematical Term Extraction;"Zhong, Maosheng; Kuang, Jiangling; Liu, GanLin; Hua, Xin; Wu, Jiahua";2023;IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS;Article;WoS;10.1109/MIS.2023.3246240;Term extraction aims to extract domain-specific terminology from documents. Secondary school mathematics terminology plays a guiding role in the learning and teaching of secondary school mathematics. We found that there needs to be more work in this field and that there are two main issues in extracting the terms from the middle school mathematics text: the polysemy of one character problem and nested terms problem. Accordingly, we have constructed a secondary school mathematics corpus and proposed a model to resolve these problems, termed BERT-LLA-CRF. Using pretraining to obtain dynamic word vectors to improve the model's understanding of text semantics and solve the problem of multiple meanings of one word, the proposed model integrates attention mechanisms and Chinese character information to solve the nested terminology problem. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively solves those problems and achieves good middle-school mathematics term extraction results.

Generative AI offers the potential to provide naturalistic, contextualised and adaptive conversations. What this paper adds Develops a novel generative AI-powered teachable agent for middle school mathematics learning, called ALTER-Math. Reports the iterative design process involving empirical classroom implementations of ALTER-Math. Reveals a bigger significant improvement in the student's mathematical knowledge after using ALTER-Math, compared to the control group. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers can be inspired by this design example of a theoretically grounded generative AI learning technology. Educational technology designers could hear the real voices of students and teachers about the generative AI learning technologies. Researchers and educational technology designers could be directed by the design implications to the future design of AI-powered learning technologies and teachable agents.
The More Anxious, the More Dependent? The Impact of Math Anxiety on AI-Assisted Problem-Solving;"Chen, Feng; Chen, Jihe; Xu, Yanying";2025;PSYCHOLOGY IN THE SCHOOLS;Article;WoS;10.1002/pits.23500;"Although the use of AI technology driven by anxiety has become increasingly common, research on the relationship between high school students' math anxiety and their intention to use AI for problem-solving remains limited. This study, grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, aims to explore the relationship between math anxiety and the intention to use AI for solving math problems among high school students. Using the Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS), the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), and the AI Problem-Solving Behavior Scale (AIPS), data from 391 high school students were collected. The analysis revealed the following: (1) Students Report high levels of math anxiety and a strong inclination to use AI tools for solving math problems; (2) Social support plays a significant role in alleviating math anxiety, with family support being the most effective, followed by support from friends and teachers; (3) High levels of family support are the most effective means of reducing math anxiety. The study suggests that the relationship between math anxiety and AI use intention should be addressed, with a focus on regulating the application of AI in math education to promote its scientific and effective use. Additionally, improving family relationships and providing mental health support are recommended to alleviate math anxiety from an emotional and social support perspective. This study provides valuable insights for educators and policymakers, offering important references for designing more human-centered and effective educational interventions, thereby promoting the application of artificial intelligence technology in mathematics education."
Empirical Research on AI Technology-Supported Precision Teaching in High School Science Subjects;"Hao, Miaomiao; Wang, Yi; Peng, Jun";2024;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;Article;WoS;10.3390/app14177544;"The empowerment of educational reform and innovation through AI technology has become a topic of increasing interest in the field of education. The advent of AI technology has made comprehensive and in-depth teaching evaluation possible, serving as a significant driving force for efficient and precise teaching. There were few empirical studies on the application of high-quality precision teaching models in the field of compulsory education, and the learning difficulty of technology and the teaching burden on teachers have become significant factors hindering the use of technology to support education. This study analyzed teaching models from the perspectives of teachers' teaching burdens and students' learning obstacles, and was committed to relying on intelligent technology to construct a new precision teaching model, an educational diagnosis-feedback-intervention path that covered the entire teaching process, from the dimensions of teacher behavior, student behavior, and parent behavior, aiming to assist teachers in efficient teaching and students in personalized learning. This study was conducted with nine science classes, including about 540 people in the second year of high school at a Middle School in China; six classes were the intervention groups while the last three classes were control groups, and a survey of 19 teachers from the intervention classes was carried out. The results showed that this model can significantly improve students' academic performance in science subjects, especially in mathematics and chemistry. It has increased the proportion of high-achieving students, reduced the proportion of low-achieving students, stimulated students' self-directed learning ability, cultivated a positive attitude towards science learning, and explained the key points of using a precision teaching model in different disciplines. It has achieved a deep integration of education and technology, helping to increase the efficiency and reduce the burden of teaching."
Factors Influencing Tandem Learning in Mathematics;"Bregant, Bor; Doz, Daniel; Hudovernik, Sanela";2025;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION;Article;WoS;10.29333/iji.2025.18124a;The main objective of secondary education institutions is to provide quality education to its students. One way to achieve this is by introducing various teaching methods, one of which is tandem learning, which is a small-group cooperative learning method. Not everyone responds well to a one-size-fits-all method, and therefore, uncovering insights for predictive model selection tailored to individual students or classrooms becomes imperative for teaching institutions. The knowledge is embedded in the educational data set and is extractable through data mining techniques. The primary objective of the study was to identify the key factors that significantly influence student outcomes (including both emotional well-being and knowledge improvement) in tandem learning using machine learning algorithms. The study was conducted in a mathematics class during the course of one week of tandem learning implementation in the school year 2023/24 with a sample of 89 high school students from a selected Slovene high school and interaction, and whether the student outperformed their partner). The outcome of interest was a three-state dependent variable indicating whether the student responded well to the implementation of tandem learning into the education environment. The present study tested which predictor variables were most important using mutual information and recursive feature elimination for all variables. The most important factors according to mutual information for predicting student response were outperforming the partner, class, and qualitative qualitative interaction, outperforming partner and gender.
Applying Machine Learning and SHAP Method to Identify Key Influences on Middle-School Students' Mathematics Literacy Performance;"Huang, Ying; Zhou, Ying; Chen, Jihe; Wu, Danyan";2024;JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENCE;Article;WoS;10.3390/jintelligence12100093;The PISA 2022 literacy assessment highlights a significant decline in math performance among most OECD countries, with the magnitude of this decline being approximately three times that of the previous round. Remarkably, Hong Kong, Macao, Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea ranked in the top six among all participating countries or economies, with Taipei, Singapore, Japan, and Korea also demonstrating improved performance. Given the widespread concern about the factors influencing secondary-school students' mathematical literacy, this paper adopts machine learning and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to analyze 34,968 samples and 151 features from six East Asian education systems within the PISA 2022 dataset, aiming to pinpoint the crucial factors that affect middle-school students' mathematical literacy. First, the XGBoost model has the highest prediction accuracy for math literacy performance. Second, 15 variables were identified as significant predictors of mathematical literacy across the student population, particularly variables such as mathematics self-efficacy (MATHEFF) and expected occupational status (BSMJ). Third, mathematics self-efficacy was determined to be the most influential factor. Fourth, the factors influencing mathematical literacy vary among individual students, including the key influencing factors, the direction (positive or negative) of their impact, and the extent of this influence. Finally, based on our findings, four recommendations are proffered to enhance the mathematical literacy performance of secondary-school students.
An Al-BERT-Bi-GRU-LDA algorithm for negative sentiment analysis on Bilibili comments;"Liang, Ziyu; Chen, Jun";2024;PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE;Article;WoS;10.7717/peerj-cs.2029;The number of online self-learning users has been increasing due to the promotion of various lifelong learning programs. Unstructured commentary text related to their real learning experience regarding the learning process is generally published by users to show their opinions and complaints. The article aims to utilize the dataset of real text comments of 10 high school mathematics courses participated by high school students in the Bilibili platform and construct a hybrid algorithm called the Artificial Intelligence-Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) + Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to crunch data and extract their sentiments.

The outcomes are promising that the fundamental issues underlined by the students can be effectively resolved to improve curriculum and teaching quality.
Teaching Plan Generation and Evaluation With GPT-4: Unleashing the Potential of LLM in Instructional Design;"Hu, Bihao; Zheng, Longwei; Zhu, Jiayi; Ding, Lishan; Wang, Yilei; Gu, Xiaoqing";2024;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1109/TLT.2024.3384765;This study explores and analyzes the specific performance of large language models (LLMs) in instructional design, aiming to unveil their potential strengths and possible weaknesses. Recently, the influence of LLMs has gradually increased in multiple fields, yet exploratory research on their application in education remains relatively scarce. In response to this situation, our research, grounded in pedagogical content knowledge theory, initially formulated an instructional design framework based on mathematical problem chains and corresponding prompt instructions. Subsequently, a comprehensive tool for assessing LLM's instructional design capabilities was developed. Utilizing Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, a high school mathematics teaching plan dataset was generated. Finally, the performance of LLMs in instructional design was evaluated. The evaluation results revealed that the teaching plans generated by LLMs excel in setting instructional objectives, identifying teaching priorities, organizing problem chains and teaching activities, articulating subject content, and selecting methods and strategies. Particularly commendable performance was noted in the modules of statistics and functions. However, there is room for improvement in aspects related to mathematical culture and interdisciplinary assessment, as well as in the geometry and algebra modules. Lastly, this study proposes initiatives, such as LLM prompt-based teacher training and the integration of mathematics-focused LLMs. These suggestions aim to advance personalized instructional design and professional development of teachers, offering educators new insights into the in-depth application of LLMs.
Predicting Math Performance in High School Students using Machine Learning Techniques;Hui, Yuan;2024;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.14569/IJACSA.2024.0150516;In the field of education, understanding and predicting student performance plays a crucial role in improving the quality of system management decisions. In this study, the power of various machine learning techniques to learn the complicated task of predicting students' performance in math courses using demographic data of 395 students was investigated. Predicting students' performance through demographic information makes it possible to predict their performance before the start of the course. Filtered and wrapper feature selection methods were used to find 10 important features in predicting students' final math grades. Then, all the features of the data set as well as the 10 selected features of each of the feature selection methods were used as input for the regression analysis with the Adaboost model. Finally, the prediction performance of each of these feature sets in predicting students' math grades was evaluated using criteria such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and mean squared error. The best result was obtained from feature selection by the LASSO method. After the LASSO method for feature selection, the Extra Tree and Gradient Boosting Machine methods respectively had the best prediction of the final math grade. The present study showed that the LASSO feature selection technique integrated with regression analysis with the Adaboost model is a suitable data mining framework for predicting students' mathematical performance.
ChatGPT-Based Simulation Helps to Develop the Pre-Service Mathematics Teachers' Critical Thinking;"Drushlyak, Marina; Lukashova, Tetiana; Shamonia, Volodymyr; Semenikhina, Olena";2025;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION;Article;WoS;10.29333/iji.2025.1819a;"The development of IT affects society in general and the education sector in particular. The emergence of AI (in particular ChatGPT), which is constantly being improved, already causes specific problems in the organization and administration of the educational process. Still, the peculiarities of its functioning make it possible to perceive ChatGPT as learning means in the pre-service mathematics teachers' training. The article presents the results of a study that answers the following questions: (1) Can ChatGPT be a digital platform that generates pupils' answers (secondary school)?- Yes; (2) Are students (pre- service mathematics teachers) prepared to check answers that ChatGPT generates?- Yes; (3) Does checking answers that ChatGPT generates affect the development of students' critical thinking?- Yes. The study involved a pedagogical experiment in which authors described how ChatGPT generates solutions to math problems and what mistakes it makes. We ensured that students sometimes find mathematical mistakes in the answers generated by ChatGPT, but repeated use of ChatGPT shows its positive impact on the development of pre- service mathematics teachers' critical thinking."
Using artificial intelligence in education: decision tree learning results in secondary school students based on cold and hot executive functions;"Escolano-Perez, Elena; Losada, Jose Luis";2024;HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.1057/s41599-024-04040-y;Improving educational quality is a universal concern. Despite efforts made in this regard, learning outcomes have not improved sufficiently. Therefore, further investigation is needed on this issue, adopting new perspectives (conceptual and analytical) to facilitate the understanding and design of effective actions. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of executive functions (considering both cognitive and affective processes) and their interactions on learning outcomes in Language and Literature and Mathematics in Spanish students, through the use of artificial intelligence, based on the machine learning approach, and more specifically, the decision tree technique. A total of 173 students in compulsory secondary education (12-17 years old) from the same educational institution participated. The school's educational counsellor provided information on student executive function levels by completing the BRIEF2 questionnaire for each participant. She also Reported on the learning outcomes achieved by students in the subjects of interest for this research (Language and Literature and Mathematics). R software was used to model the regression trees. The results revealed groups of students characterised by different profiles, i.e., by different combinations of difficulties in various executive functions and varying levels of learning outcomes in each academic area. However, regardless of the academic area considered (Language and Literature or Mathematics), working memory was identified as the most relevant executive function in all of the students' learning outcomes. Understanding the combination of executive functions that predict learning outcomes in each group of students is important since it enables teachers and other educational professionals, policymakers and researchers to provide individualised educational resources according to the diverse student profiles and needs. It constitutes an effective mechanism to improve students' learning results and, ultimately, to enhance an equitable and more effective educational system.
An Effective Decision-Making Support for Student Academic Path Selection using Machine Learning;"Houngue, Pelagie; Hountondji, Michel; Dagba, Theophile";2022;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;;In Benin, after the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), learners can either enroll in a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), or further their studies in the general education. Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6(th) to 9(th) grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners' ability and the stream. As a result, for learners' ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners' stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods. Furthermore, it provides a tool to ease students academic path selection, which may be used by educational institutes to ensure student performance. This paper presents the steps and the outputs of the study, we performed with some recommendations for future research.
Are perfect transcripts necessary when we analyze classroom dialogue using AIoT?;"Wang, Deliang; Chen, Gaowei";2024;INTERNET OF THINGS;Article;WoS;10.1016/j.iot.2024.101105;Classroom dialogue plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of teaching and learning. Many researchers have utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) to develop models and systems for automatic analysis and feedback. However, the question of whether we should employ these AIoT tools on automatic transcripts of classroom dialogue generated by automatic speech recognition software or on transcripts that have undergone human revision remains unresolved, which involves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Thus, this paper examines whether perfect transcripts are needed to analyze talk moves in classroom dialogue. We initially constructed two deep learning models to analyze teacher talk moves in K-12 mathematics lessons. Subsequently, we collected an additional set of six K-12 mathematics lesson videos and used a classroom dialogue analysis system equipped with speech recognition software to automatically transcribe them, resulting in ASR_pure transcripts. These transcripts were then manually revised and verified to create ASR_human transcripts. A comparison between the two types of transcripts revealed evident errors in the ASR_pure transcripts. Next, we employed the developed AI models to predict talk moves in both ASR_pure and ASR_human transcripts and assessed their consistency. The findings demonstrate a high level of consistency in talk move prediction between the two types of transcripts across the six lessons. Furthermore, the ASR_pure transcripts also exhibit high consistency in specific talk moves (e.g., pressing for accuracy) when compared to ASR_human transcripts. We propose a hypoThesis that this consistency between inaccurate ASR_pure transcripts and perfect ASR_human transcripts can be attributed to the ASR software accurately recognizing key indicators that serve as talk moves, rather than accurately identifying every word. Notably, upon removing the key indicator words from teacher utterances, both the talk move level and lesson level consistency experience a substantial decline. Therefore, we suggest that perfect transcripts of classroom dialogue may not be necessary for AIoT to analyze teacher talk moves and provide teachers with prompt and accurate feedback, especially when the ASR software can accurately recognize keywords.
Toward learning progression analytics - Developing learning environments for the automated analysis of learning using evidence centered design;"Kubsch, Marcus; Czinczel, Berrit; Lossjew, Jannik; Wyrwich, Tobias; Bednorz, David; Bernholt, Sascha; Fiedler, Daniela; Strauss, Sebastian; Cress, Ulrike; Drachsler, Hendrik; Neumann, Knut; Rummel, Nikol";2022;FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION;Article;WoS;10.3389/feduc.2022.981910;National educational standards stress the importance of science and mathematics learning for today's students. However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students' needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students' individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students' science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both - meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students' learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students' learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students' learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students' learning - the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.
Learn with M.E.-Let Us Boost Personalized Learning in K-12 Math Education!;"Annus, Norbert; Kmet, Tibor";2024;EDUCATION SCIENCES;Article;WoS;10.3390/educsci14070773;The traditional educational system, in certain aspects, limits personalized learning. This is mainly evident in the fact that average students, who do not have any learning difficulties, are required to solve the same tasks from the same textBook in the same order. Artificial intelligence and other smart learning tools present great opportunities for implementing a personalized learning system. Our previous surveys and literature reviews also show that educators see the greatest potential in personalized education for the assimilation of artificial intelligence into education. In this context, we have developed educational software called Learn with M.E. as Math Educator, which facilitates more personalized teaching of basic mathematical operations. This study presents the structure and operation of this application. We tested the usability of the software in several institutions. Our research target group consists of elementary school students, specifically those aged 11-15. This article provides a detailed overview of the accuracy and educational outcomes of the completed application. We evaluated the application and its effectiveness using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our research design combined elements of educational technology development and effectiveness assessment. To evaluate student performance, we employed a control group methodology. Data were analyzed by comparing test results between students using the software and those receiving traditional instruction. We examined user satisfaction through survey questionnaires. Teachers' opinions were gathered through structured interviews, and their responses were categorized using a SWOT analysis. The findings indicated that the use of the software significantly improved students' mathematics performance compared to the control group. Students provided positive feedback on the software's user interface, describing it as user-friendly and motivating. Teachers regarded the software as an effective educational tool, facilitating differentiated instruction and enhancing student engagement. The results suggest that digital educational tools, such as the developed software, can provide substantial added value in education.

However, there is still room for improvement in maximising the social returns they provide on investments.Many factors and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on providing public administration with advanced decision-making tools.First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of the Programa para la Mejora de ' Exito Educativo (Programme for the Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla y Le ' on in Spain, in 2018-2019, the academic year previous to the pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO).Second, we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and explained how different factors and components affect student engagement and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol.

The DLDC methods aim to leverage the flexibility and ever-increasing resources of deep learning and rich literature on numerical analysis to formulate a general class of numerical methods that can directly use data with uncertainty to predict the behavior of an unknown system as well as elevate the speed and accuracy of numerical solution of the governing equations for known systems. The article is structured into two major sections. In the first section, the building blocks of the DLDC methods are presented and deep learning structures analogous to traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element methods are constructed with a view to incorporate these techniques in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics syllabus for K-12 students. The second section builds upon the building blocks of the previous discussion and proposes new solution schemes for differential and integral equations pertinent to multiscale mechanics. Each section is accompanied by a mathematical formulation of the numerical methods, analogous DLDC formulation, and suitable examples.

AI-based adaptive personalized content presentation and exercises navigation for an effective and engaging E-learning platform;"Sayed, Wafaa S.; Noeman, Ahmed M.; Abdellatif, Abdelrahman; Abdelrazek, Moemen; Badawy, Mostafa G.; Hamed, Ahmed; El-Tantawy, Samah";2023;MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS;Article;WoS;10.1007/s11042-022-13076-8;Effective and engaging E-learning becomes necessary in unusual conditions such as COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the early stages of K-12 education. This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed.
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model-Based Explainable Recommender;"Takami, Kyosuke; Flanagan, Brendan; Dai, Yiling; Ogata, Hiroaki";2024;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.4018/IJDET.337600;Explainable recommendation, which provides an explanation about why a quiz is recommended, helps to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, little research examined the effectiveness of the explainable recommender, especially on academic performance. To survey its effectiveness, the authors evaluate the math academic performance among middle school students (n=115) by giving pre- and post-test questions based evaluation techniques. During the pre- and post-test periods, students were encouraged to use the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model based explainable recommendation system. To evaluate how well the students were able to do what they could not do, the authors defined growth rate and found recommended quiz clicked counts had a positive effect on the total number of solved quizzes (R=0.343, P=0.005) and growth rate (R=0.297, P=0.017) despite no correlation between the total number of solved quizzes and growth rate. The results suggest that the use of an explainable recommendation system that learns efficiently will enable students to do what they could not do before.
Investigating dialogic interaction in K12 online one-on-one mathematics tutoring using AI and sequence mining techniques;Wang, Deliang and Shan, Dapeng and Ju, Ran and Kao, Ben and Zhang, Chenwei and Chen, Gaowei;2024;EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES;Article;WoS;10.1007/s10639-024-13195-9;Online one-on-one tutoring serves as a supplementary approach to traditional classroom instruction. It has been shown to enhance personalized learning and academic performance. However, the dynamics of dialogic interactions within this educational setting are not fully understood. Thus, we present a computational analysis of dialogic interactions in online one-on-one mathematics tutoring. Specifically, we devised a coding scheme tailored to online tutoring sessions and leveraged advanced artificial intelligence techniques to construct an automated model for annotating dialog acts. We then investigated the basic characteristics and interaction patterns in a dataset encompassing online one-on-one tutoring dialogs within K-12 mathematics education and obtained insightful findings. First, tutors were found to often apply both didactic and other effective teaching strategies. Second, off-task chatting accounted for a significant proportion of tutoring sessions. Third, high school students exhibited greater engagement and cognitive abilities than primary and middle school students through their more active participation and superior reasoning skills. Primary school students, despite their less active participation, responded positively when engaged by tutors. The findings highlight the importance of optimizing strategies applied by tutors and students to create a more dynamic and effective learning environment and provide valuable insights into the nature of online one-on-one tutoring.
